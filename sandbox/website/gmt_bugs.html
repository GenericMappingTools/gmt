To file a bug report, please open a New Issue on the GMT trac <A HREF="http://gmtrac.soest.hawaii.edu" target="_blank">GMT trac</A> site (registration is require to add Issues).
Make sure your email includes the following information:
<UL>
<LI>Version of GMT you are using (e.g., type psxy - to see what is reported).
<LI>Is this a 32-bit or 64-bit installation of GMT?
<LI>If GMT 5, did you install using the GMT 4 compatibility mode?
<LI>Hardware platform and Operating System, including version (e.g., under Unix-like systems, type uname -a to get details; for Windows, just tell us what version).
<LI>Individual GMT program that may have a bug.
<LI>A clear explanation of the problem.
<LI>Example script or command line and, if necessary, test data that
recreate the problem.  If the problem occurs for a huge
data set, try to see if the problem can be reproduced with
a smaller subset.  Do not upload large data files that
exceed a few Mb - we will contact you should we need further
information.
<LI>Other pieces of relevant information
</UL>
The easier we can reproduce the problem then the quicker we can fix it.  Some bugs are
platform-dependent and can only be reproduced on that system; we have several Linux-flavors
running in a simulator for that purpose.  The subversion repository of GMT will immediately be updated
once a fix has been found.
Note that sometimes a work-around can be crafted while waiting for the next official release.  You may want
to check the <A HREF="http://gmtrac.soest.hawaii.edu" target="_blank">GMT Wiki</A> to see if anything relevant have been added.
