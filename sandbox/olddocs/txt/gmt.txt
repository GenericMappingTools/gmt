.SH NAME
gmt \- The Generic Mapping Tools data processing and display software package
.SH INTRODUCTION
BD(GMT) is a collection of public-domain Unix tools that allows you to manipulate
x,y and x,y,z data sets (filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.)
and produce IT(PostScript) illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots, via
contour maps, to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D perspective
views in black/white or full color.  Linear, log10, and power scaling is supported in
addition to over 30 common map projections.  The processing and display routines
within BD(GMT) are completely general and will handle any (x,y) or (x,y,z) data
as input.
.SH SYNOPSIS
