originator \- Associate seamounts with nearest hotspot point sources
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(originator) [ IT(table) ] OPT(E)[BD(+)]IT(rotfile) 
OPT(F)[BD(+)]IT(hs_file) 
[ OPT(D)IT(d_km) ] [ OPT(L)[IT(flag)] ] [ OPT(N)IT(upper_age) ] [ OPT(Q)IT(r/t) ] 
[ OPT(S)[IT(n_hs)] ] [ OPT(T) ] [ GMT_V_OPT ]  OPT(W)IT(maxdist) ] [ OPT(Z) ]
[ GMT_bi_OPT ] [ GMT_h_OPT ] [ GMT_i_OPT ] [ GMT_colon_OPT ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(originator) reads (longitude, latitude, height, radius, crustal_age) records from IT(infiles) 
[or standard input] and uses the given Absolute Plate Motion (APM) stage or total reconstruction
rotation file and the list of hotspot locations to determine the most likely origin (hotspot)
for each seamount.  It does so by calculating flowlines back in time and determining
the closest approach to all hotspots.  The output consists of the input records with
four additional fields added for each of the IT(n_hs) closest hotspots.  The four fields
are the hotspot id (e.g., HWI), the stage id of the flowline segment that came closest,
the pseudo-age of the seamount, and the closest distance to the hotspot (in km).
See option OPT(:) on how to read (latitude, longitude,height, radius, crustal_age) files.
#include "explain_commonitems.txt"
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
#include "euler.txt"
Prepend BD(+) if you want to invert the rotations prior to use.
#include "hotspot.txt"
Prepend BD(+) if we should look for hotspot drift tables whose name must be IT(hs_abbrev)_drift.txt.
Such files may be located in the current directory, the same directory as IT(hs_file), or in
the directories pointed to by GMT_DATADIR.
If found then we interpolate to get hotspot location as a function of time [fixed].
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
#include "explain_intables.txt"
.TP
OPT(D)IT(d_km)
Sets the flowline sampling interval in km.  [Default is 5].
.TP
OPT(L)[IT(flag)]
Output closest approach for nearest hotspot only (ignores OPT(S)).
Choose OPT(Lt) for (IT(time), IT(dist), IT(z)) [Default], OPT(Lw) for (IT(omega), IT(dist), IT(z)),
and OPT(Ll) for (lon, lat, time, dist, z).  Normally, IT(dist) is in km; use
upper case modifiers BD(TWL) to get IT(dist) in spherical degrees.
.TP
OPT(N)IT(upper_age)
Set the maximum age to extend the oldest stage back in time [no extension].
.TP
OPT(Q)IT(r/t)
.TP
Input files only has (IT(x),IT(y),IT(z)); specify constant values for IT(r),IT(t) that
will be implied for each record.
.TP
OPT(S)[IT(n_hs)]
Set the number of closest hotspots to report [Default is 1].
.TP
OPT(T)
Truncate seamount ages exceeding the upper age set with OPT(N) [no truncation].
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(W)IT(maxdist)
Only report those seamounts whose flowlines came within IT(maxdist) to any hotspot
[Default reports all seamounts].
.TP
OPT(Z)
Use the hotspot ID number rather than the name tag in output records.
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is 5 input columns].
#include "explain_-h.txt"
#include "explain_-icols.txt"
#include "explain_colon.txt"
#include "explain_help.txt"
.SH EXAMPLES
To find the likely (hotspot) origins of the seamounts represented by the (x,y,z,r,tc) points
in the file seamounts.d, using the DC85.d Euler poles and the pac_hs.d list of possible hotspots,
and report the 2 most likely hotspot candidates for each seamount, run
.br
.sp
originator seamounts.d -S2 -EDC85.d -Fpac_hs.d > origins.d
.br
.sp
To determine the predicted age of a seamount, distances to the closest hotspot, and echo the observed age given its location, observed age, and a rotation model, try
.br
.sp
echo "1.55 -8.43 52.3" | originator -FONeill_2005_hotspots.txt -EOMS2005_APM_fixed.txt -Q1/120 -Lt
.br
.sp
where 52.3 Ma is observed age.  The output is 70 -95.486 52.3.  To repeat the same exercise with a moving hotspot model, try
.br
.sp
echo "1.55 -8.43 52.3" | originator -F+ONeill_2005_hotspots.txt -EOMS2005_APM_smooth.txt -Q1/120 -Lt
.br
.sp
Now the output is 80 -213.135 52.3.  Negative distances means the closest approach was east of the hotspot.
