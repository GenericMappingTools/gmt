1 What is NetCDF?
*****************

NetCDF is a set of data formats, programming interfaces, and software
libraries that help read and write scientific data files.

   NetCDF was developed and is maintained at Unidata, part of the
University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Office of
Programs (UOP). Unidata is funded primarily by the National Science
Foundation.

   Unidata provides data and software tools for use in geoscience
education and research. For more information see the web sites of
Unidata (`http://www.unidata.ucar.edu'), UOP
(`http://www.uop.ucar.edu'), and UCAR (`http://www.ucar.edu').

   This tutorial may serve as an introduction to netCDF. Full netCDF
documentation is available on-line (*note Documentation::).

1.1 The Classic NetCDF Data Model
=================================

The classic netCDF data model consists of "variables", "dimensions",
and "attributes". This way of thinking about data was introduced with
the very first netCDF release, and is still the core of all netCDF
files.

   (In version 4.0, the netCDF data model has been expanded. *Note
Common Data Model::.)

`Variables'
     N-dimensional arrays of data. Variables in netCDF files can be one
     of six types (char, byte, short, int, float, double). For more
     information see *note Variables: (netcdf)Variables.

`Dimensions'
     describe the axes of the data arrays. A dimension has a name and a
     length. An unlimited dimension has a length that can be expanded
     at any time, as more data are written to it. NetCDF files can
     contain at most one unlimited dimension. For more information see
     *note Dimensions: (netcdf)Dimensions.

`Attributes'
     annotate variables or files with small notes or supplementary
     metadata. Attributes are always scalar values or 1D arrays, which
     can be associated with either a variable or the file as a whole.
     Although there is no enforced limit, the user is expected to keep
     attributes small. For more information see *note Attributes:
     (netcdf)Attributes.


   For more information on the netCDF data model see *note The NetCDF
Data Model: (netcdf)The NetCDF Data Model.

1.1.1 Meteorological Example
----------------------------

NetCDF can be used to store many kinds of data, but it was originally
developed for the Earth science community.

   NetCDF views the world of scientific data in the same way that an
atmospheric scientist might: as sets of related arrays. There are
various physical quantities (such as pressure and temperature) located
at points at a particular latitude, longitude, vertical level, and time.

   A scientist might also like to store supporting information, such as
the units, or some information about how the data were produced.

   The axis information (latitude, longitude, level, and time) would be
stored as netCDF dimensions. Dimensions have a length and a name.

   The physical quantities (pressure, temperature) would be stored as
netCDF variables. Variables are N-dimensional arrays of data, with a
name and an associated set of netCDF dimensions.

   It is also customary to add one variable for each dimension, to hold
the values along that axis. These variables are called "coordinate
variables." The latitude coordinate variable would be a one-dimensional
variable (with latitude as its dimension), and it would hold the
latitude values at each point along the axis.

   The additional bits of metadata would be stored as netCDF attributes.

   Attributes are always single values or one-dimensional arrays. (This
works out well for a string, which is a one-dimensional array of ASCII
characters.)

   The pres_temp_4D example in this tutorial shows how to write and read
a file containing some four-dimensional pressure and temperature data,
including all the metadata needed. *Note pres_temp_4D::.

1.2 The Common Data Model and NetCDF-4
======================================

With netCDF-4, the netCDF data model has been extended, in a backwards
compatible way.

   The new data model, which is known as the "Common Data Model" is
part of an effort here at Unidata to find a common engineering language
for the development of scientific data solutions. It contains the
variables, dimensions, and attributes of the classic data model, but
adds:

   * groups A way of hierarchically organizing data, similar to
     directories in a Unix file system.

   * user-defined types The user can now define compound types (like C
     structures), enumeration types, variable length arrays, and opaque
     types.


   These features may only be used when working with a netCDF-4/HDF5
file. Files created in classic or 64-bit offset format cannot support
groups or user-defined types.

   With netCDF-4/HDF5 files, the user may define groups, which may
contain variables, dimensions, and attributes. In this way, a group
acts as a container for the classic netCDF dataset. But netCDF-4/HDF5
files can have many groups, organized hierarchically.

   Each file begins with at least one group, the root group. The user
may then add more groups, receiving a new ncid for each group created.

   Since each group functions as a complete netCDF classic dataset, it
is possible to have variables with the same name in two or more
different groups, within the same netCDF-4/HDF5 data file.

   Dimensions have a special scope: they may be seen by all variables in
their group, and all descendant groups. This allows the user to define
dimensions in a top-level group, and use them in many sub-groups.

   Since it may be necessary to write code which works with all types of
netCDF data files, we also introduce the ability to create
netCDF-4/HDF5 files which follow all the rules of the classic netCDF
model. That is, these files are in HDF5, but will not support multiple
unlimited dimensions, user-defined types, groups, etc. They act just
like a classic netCDF file.

1.3 NetCDF Error Handling
=========================

Each netCDF function in the C, Fortran 77, and Fortran 90 APIs returns
0 on success, in the tradition of C. (For C++, see below).

   When programming with netCDF in these languages, always check return
values of every netCDF API call. The return code can be looked up in
netcdf.h (for C programmers) or netcdf.inc (for Fortran programmers),
or you can use the strerror function to print out an error message.
(See *note nc_strerror: (netcdf-c)nc_strerror./*note NF_STRERROR:
(netcdf-f77)NF_STRERROR./*note NF90_STRERROR:
(netcdf-f90)NF90_STRERROR.).

   In general, if a function returns an error code, you can assume it
didn't do what you hoped it would. The exception is the NC_ERANGE
error, which is returned by any of the reading or writing functions
when one or more of the values read or written exceeded the range for
the type. (For example if you were to try to read 1000 into an unsigned
byte.)

   In the case of NC_ERANGE errors, the netCDF library completes the
read/write operation, and then returns the error. The type conversion
is handled like a C type conversion, whether or not it is within range.
This may yield bad data, but the netCDF library just returns NC_ERANGE
and leaves it up to the user to handle. (For more information about
type conversion *note Type Conversion: (netcdf-c)Type Conversion.).

   Error handling in C++ is different. For some objects, the is_valid()
method should be called. Other error handling is controlled by the
NcError class. For more information see *note Class NcError:
(netcdf-cxx)Class NcError.

   For a complete list of netCDF error codes see *note Error Codes:
(netcdf-c)Error Codes.

1.4 Unlimited Dimensions
========================

Sometimes you don't know the size of all dimensions when you create a
file, or you would like to arbitrarily extend the file along one of the
dimensions.

   For example, model output usually has a time dimension. Rather than
specifying that there will be forty-two output times when creating the
file, you might like to create it with one time, and then add data for
additional times, until you wanted to stop.

   For this purpose netCDF provides the unlimited dimension. By
specifying a length of "unlimited" when defining a dimension, you
indicate to netCDF that the dimension may be extended, and its length
may increase.

   In netCDF classic files, there can only be one unlimited dimension,
and it must be declared first in the list of dimensions for a variable.

   For programmers, the unlimited dimension will correspond with the
slowest-varying dimension. In C this is the first dimension of an
array, in Fortran, the last.

   The third example in this tutorial, pres_temp_4D, demonstrates how to
write and read data one time step at a time along an unlimited
dimension in a classic netCDF file. *Note pres_temp_4D::.

   In netCDF-4/HDF5 files, any number of unlimited dimensions may be
used, and there is no restriction as to where they appear in a
variable's list of dimension IDs.

   For more detailed information about dimensions see *note Dimensions:
(netcdf)Dimensions.

1.5 Fill Values
===============

Sometimes there are missing values in the data, and some value is
needed to represent them.

   For example, what value do you put in a sea-surface temperature
variable for points over land?

   In netCDF, you can create an attribute for the variable (and of the
same type as the variable) called "_FillValue" that contains a value
that you have used for missing data. Applications that read the data
file can use this to know how to represent these values.

   Using attributes it is possible to capture metadata that would
otherwise be separated from the data. Various conventions have been
established. By using a set of conventions, a data producer is more
likely to produce files that can be easily shared within the research
community, and that contain enough details to be useful as a long-term
archive.  Conventions also make it easier to develop software that
interprets information represented in data, because a convention
selects one conventional way to represent information when multiple
equivalent representations are possible.

   For more information on _FillValue and other attribute conventions,
see *note Attribute Conventions: (netcdf)Attribute Conventions.

   Climate and meteorological users are urged to follow the Climate and
Forecast (CF) metadata conventions when producing data files. For more
information about the CF conventions, see `http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov'.

   For information about creating attributes, see *note Creation::.

1.6 Tools for Manipulating NetCDF Files
=======================================

Many existing software applications can read and manipulate netCDF
files. Before writing your own program, check to see if any existing
programs meet your needs.

   Two utilities come with the netCDF distribution: ncdump and ncgen.
The ncdump command reads a netCDF file and outputs text in a format
called CDL. The ncgen command reads a text file in CDL format, and
generates a netCDF data file.

   One common use for ncdump is to examine the metadata of a netCDF
file, to see what it contains. At the beginning of each example in this
tutorial, an ncdump of the resulting data file is shown. *Note
simple_xy::.

   For more information about ncdump and ncgen see *note NetCDF
Utilities: (netcdf)NetCDF Utilities.

   The following general-purpose tools have been found to be useful in
many situations. Some of the tools on this list are developed at
Unidata. The others are developed elsewhere, and we can make no
guarantees about their continued availability or success. All of these
tools are open-source.

support-netcdf@unidata.ucar.edu.

1.7 The NetCDF Programming APIs
===============================

Unidata supports netCDF APIs in C, C++, Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and
Java.

   The Java API is a complete implementation of netCDF in Java. It is
distributed independently of the other APIs. For more information see
the netCDF Java page:
`http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java'. If you are writing
web server software, you should certainly be doing so in Java.

   The C, C++, Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 APIs are distributed and
installed when the netCDF C library is built, if compilers exist to
build them, and if they are not turned off when configuring the netCDF
build.

   The C++ and Fortran APIs depend on the C API. Due to the nature of
C++ and Fortran 90, users of those languages can also use the C and
Fortran 77 APIs (respectively) directly.

   In the netCDF-4.0 beta release, only the C API is well-tested. The
Fortran APIs include support for netCDF-4 advanced features, but need
more testing, which will be added in a future release of netCDF.

   The C++ API can handle netCDF-4.0/HDF5 files, but can not yet handle
advanced netCDF-4 features. The successor to the current C++ API is
under active development, and will include support for netCDF-4
advanced features.

   Full documentation exists for each API (*note Documentation::).

   In addition, many other language APIs exist, including Perl, Python,
and Ruby. Most of these APIs were written and supported by netCDF
users. Some of them are listed on the netCDF software page, see
`http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/software.html'. Since these
generally use the C API, they should work well with netCDF-4/HDF5
files, but the maintainers of the APIs must add support for netCDF-4
advanced features.

   In addition to the main netCDF-3 C API, there is an additional
(older) C API, the netCDF-2 API. This API produces exactly the same
files as the netCDF-3 API - only the API is different. (That is, users
can create either classic format files, the default, or 64-bit offset
files, or netCDF-4/HDF5 files.)

   The version 2 API was the API before netCDF-3.0 came out. It is still
fully supported, however. Programs written to the version 2 API will
continue to work.

   Users writing new programs should use the netCDF-3 API, which
contains better type checking, better error handling, and better
documentation.

   The netCDF-2 API is provided for backward compatibility.
Documentation for the netCDF-2 API can be found on the netCDF website,
see
`http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/old_docs/really_old/guide_toc.html'.

1.9 A Note on NetCDF Versions and Formats
=========================================

NetCDF has changed (and improved) over its lifetime. That means the
user must have some understanding of netCDF versions.

   To add to the confusion, there are versions for the APIs, and also
for the data files that they produce. The API version is the version
number that appears in the tarball file that is downloaded from the
netCDF website. For example this document applied to API version 4.1.3.

   The good news is that all netCDF files ever written can always be
read by the latest netCDF release. That is, we guarantee backward data
compatibility.

1.9.1 Classic Format
--------------------

The default format is classic format. This is the original netCDF
binary format - the format that the netCDF library has been using for
almost 20 years, since its introduction with the first release of
netCDF. No special flag is needed to create a file in classic format;
it is the default.

   Classic format has some strict limitations for files larger than two
gigabytes. (*note NetCDF Classic Format Limitations: (netcdf)NetCDF
Classic Format Limitations.).

1.9.2 64-bit Offset Format
--------------------------

In December, 2004, version 3.6.0 of the netCDF library was released. It
allows users to use a new version of the netCDF file format which
greatly expands the sizes of variables and files which may be written.

   The format which was introduced in 3.6.0 is called "64-bit Offset
Format."

   Create files in this format by passing the 64-bit offset format flag
to the create call (for example, in C, set the NC_64BIT_OFFSET flag
when calling the function nc_create. (*note nc_create:
(netcdf-c)nc_create.).

   64-bit offset is very useful for very large data files (over two
gigabytes), however these files can only be shared with those who have
upgraded to version 3.6.0 (or better) of netCDF. Earlier versions of
netCDF will not be able to read these files.

1.9.3 NetCDF-4/HDF5 Format
--------------------------

With version 4.0 of netCDF, we introduce another new data format:
netCDF-4/HDF5 format. This format is HDF5, with full use of the new
dimension scales, creation ordering, and other features of HDF5 added
in its version 1.8.0 release.

   As with 64-bit offset, this format is turned on when the file is
created. (For example, with the nf_netcdf4 flag in the nf_create
function. *note nf_create: (netcdf-f77)nf_create.).

1.9.4 Sharing Data
------------------

The classic format is the most portable. Classic format files can be
read correctly by any version of netCDF. A netCDF-4 user can create a
classic file, and share it with a user who has not upgraded netCDF
since the version 2.3 in 1994.

   64-bit offset format files can be read by any user who has at least
version 3.6.0 of the netCDF API (released in Dec., 2004).

   Users must have netCDF 4.0 to read netCDF-4/HDF5 files. However,
netCDF-4 does produce backward compatible classic and 64-bit offset
format files. That is, a netCDF-4.0 user can create a classic format
file, and share it with researchers who are still using a old version
of netCDF. Similarly a netCDF-4.0 user can read any existing netCDF
data file, whatever version of netCDF was used to create it.

1.9.5 Classic Model
-------------------

The original netCDF API represents a data model as well as a
programming API. That is, the idea of variables, attributes, and the
six data types (char, byte, short, integer, float, and double),
comprises a model of how data may be stored.

   The netCDF-4 release expands this model with groups, user-defined
types, and new base types. New functions have been added to the APIs to
accommodate these extensions, but once they are used, the file can no
longer be output as a classic format file.

   That is, once you use groups in your code, you can only produce
netCDF-4/HDF5 files. If you try to change the format to classic, you
will get an error when you attempt to use any of the group functions.

   Since it is convenient to be able to produce files of all formats
from the same code (restricting oneself to the classic data model), a
flag has been added which, when used in the creation of a netCDF-4/HDF5
file, will instruct the library to disallow the use of any advanced
features in the file.

   This is referred to as a "classic model" netCDF-4/HDF5 file.

   To get a classic model file, use the classic model flag when creating
the file. For example, in Fortran 77, use the nf_classic_model flag
when calling nf_create (*note nf_create: (netcdf-f77)nf_create.).

   For more information about format issues see *note The NetCDF Users
Guide: (netcdf)Format.

2 Example Programs
******************

The netCDF example programs show how to use netCDF.

   In the netCDF distribution, the "examples" directory contains
examples in C, Fortran 77, Fortran 90, C++, and CDL.

   There are three sets of netCDF-3 example programs in each language.
Each language has its own subdirectory under the "examples" directory
(for example, the Fortran 77 examples are in "examples/F77").

   There is also one example for netCDF-4, which is only provided in the
C language. This example will only be run if the -enable-netcdf-4
option was used with configure.

   The examples are built and run with the "make check" command. (For
more information on building netCDF, *note The NetCDF Installation and
Porting Guide: (netcdf-install)Top.).

   The examples create, and then read, example data files of increasing
complexity.

   The corresponding examples in each language create identical netCDF
data files. For example, the C program sfc_pres_temp_wr.c produces the
same data file as the Fortran 77 program sfc_pres_temp_wr.f.

   For convenience, the complete source code in each language can be
found in this tutorial, as well as in the netCDF distribution.

2.1 The simple_xy Example
=========================

This example is an unrealistically simple netCDF file, to demonstrate
the minimum operation of the netCDF APIs. Users should seek to make
their netCDF files more self-describing than this primitive example.

   As in all the netCDF tutorial examples, this example file is created
by C, Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and C++ programs, and by ncgen, which
creates it from a CDL script. All examples create identical files,
"simple_xy.nc."

   The programs that create this sample file all have the base name
"simple_xy_wr", with different extensions depending on the language.

   Therefore the example files that create simple_xy.nc can be found in:
C/simple_xy_wr.c, F77/simple_xy_wr.f, F90/simple_xy_wr.f90,
CXX/simple_xy_wr.cpp, and CDL/simple_xy_wr.cdl.

   Corresponding read programs (C/simple_xy_rd.c, etc.) read the
simple_xy.nc data file, and ensure that it contains the correct values.

   The simple_xy.nc data file contains two dimensions, "x" and "y", and
one netCDF variable, "data."

   The utility ncdump can be used to show the contents of netCDF files.
By default, ncdump shows the CDL description of the file. This CDL
description can be fed into ncgen to create the data file.

   The CDL for this example is shown below. For more information on
ncdump and ncgen see *note NetCDF Utilities: (netcdf)NetCDF Utilities.

     netcdf simple_xy {
     dimensions:
     	x = 6 ;
     	y = 12 ;
     variables:
     	int data(x, y) ;
     data:

      data =
       0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
       12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
       24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
       36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47,
       48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59,
       60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 ;
     }

2.1.1 simple_xy_wr.c and simple_xy_rd.c
---------------------------------------

These example programs can be found in the netCDF distribution, under
examples/C.

   The example program simple_xy_wr.c creates the example data file
simple_xy.nc. The example program simple_xy_rd.c reads the data file.

        This is a very simple example which writes a 2D array of

These example programs can be found in the netCDF distribution, under

   The example program simple_xy_wr.f creates the example data file

     C     This is a very simple example which writes a 2D array of
     C     sample data. To handle this in netCDF we create two shared
     C     dimensions, "x" and "y", and a netCDF variable, called "data".

     C     This example demonstrates the netCDF Fortran 77 API. This is part

     C     an ID for each one.
           integer ncid, varid, dimids(NDIMS)
           integer x_dimid, y_dimid

     C     This is the data array we will write. It will just be filled with
     C     a progression of integers for this example.
           integer data_out(NY, NX)

     C     Loop indexes, and error handling.
           integer x, y, retval

     C     Create some pretend data. If this wasn't an example program, we

     C     Always check the return code of every netCDF function call. In
     C     this example program, any retval which is not equal to nf_noerr
     C     (0) will call handle_err, which prints a netCDF error message, and
     C     then exits with a non-zero return code.

     C     Create the netCDF file. The nf_clobber parameter tells netCDF to
     C     overwrite this file, if it already exists.
           retval = nf_create(FILE_NAME, NF_CLOBBER, ncid)

     C     the variables. Note that in fortran arrays are stored in
     C     column-major format.
           dimids(2) = x_dimid
           dimids(1) = y_dimid

           retval = nf_enddef(ncid)
           if (retval .ne. nf_noerr) call handle_err(retval)

     C     Write the pretend data to the file. Although netCDF supports
     C     reading and writing subsets of data, in this case we write all the
     C     data in one operation.
           retval = nf_put_var_int(ncid, varid, data_out)

2.2 The sfc_pres_temp Example
=============================

This example has been constructed for the meteorological mind.

   Suppose you have some data you want to write to a netCDF file. For
example, you have one time step of surface temperature and surface
pressure, on a 6 x 12 latitude longitude grid.

   To store this in netCDF, create a file, add two dimensions (latitude
and longitude) and two variables (pressure and temperature).

   In this example we add some netCDF attributes, as is typical in
scientific applications, to further describe the data. In this case we
add a units attribute to every netCDF variable.

   In this example we also add additional netCDF variables to describe
the coordinate system. These "coordinate variables" allow us to specify
the latitudes and longitudes that describe the data grid.

   The CDL version of the data file, generated by ncdump, is shown
below.

   For more information on ncdump and ncgen see *note NetCDF Utilities:
(netcdf)NetCDF Utilities.

-----------------------------------------------

These example programs can be found in the netCDF distribution, under
examples/F77.

   The example program sfc_pres_temp_wr.f creates the example data file
sfc_pres_temp.nc. The example program sfc_pres_temp_rd.f reads the data
file.

2.3 The pres_temp_4D Example
============================

This example expands on the previous example by making our
two-dimensional data into four-dimensional data, adding a vertical
level axis and an unlimited time step axis.

   Additionally, in this example the data are written and read one time
step at a time, as is typical in scientific applications that use the
unlimited dimension.

   The sample data file created by pres_temp_4D_wr can be examined with
the utility ncdump. The output is shown below. For more information on
ncdump see *note NetCDF Utilities: (netcdf)NetCDF Utilities.

3 The Functions You Need in NetCDF-3
************************************

The netCDF-3 C and Fortran APIs each have over 100 functions, but most
users need only a handful. Listed below are the essential netCDF
functions for four important tasks in netCDF: creating new files,
reading existing files, learning about a netCDF file of unknown
structure, and reading and writing subsets of data.

   In each case the functions are presented for each of the four
language APIs: C, Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and C++, with hyper-links to
the detailed documentation of each function.

3.1 Creating New Files and Metadata, an Overview
================================================

To construct a netCDF file you need to:

`create the file'
     Specify the name, optionally the format: classic (the default) or
     64bit-offset.

`define metadata'
     Specify the names and types of dimensions, data variables, and
     attributes.

`write data'
     Write arrays of data from program variables to the netCDF file.
     Arrays of data may be written all at once, or in subsets.

`close the file'
     Close the file to flush all buffers to the disk and free all
     resources allocated for this file.


3.1.1 Creating a NetCDF File in C
---------------------------------

Use nc_create to create a file. Then use nc_def_dim to define each
shared dimension. The data variables are then specified with
nc_def_var. Any attributes are added with nc_put_att. Finally, call
nc_enddef to tell the library that you are done defining the metadata,
and ready to start writing the data.

   After all data are written to the file, call nc_close to ensure that
all buffers are flushed, and any resources associated with the open
file are returned to the operating system.

   For a very simple example, *Note simple_xy in C::.

3.1.2 Creating a NetCDF File in Fortran 77
------------------------------------------

Use NF_CREATE to create a file. Then use NF_DEF_DIM to define each
shared dimension. The data variables are then specified with
NF_DEF_VAR. Any attributes are added with NF_PUT_ATT. Finally, call
NF_ENDDEF to tell the library that you are done defining the metadata,
and ready to start writing the data.

   After all data are written to the file, call NF_CLOSE to ensure that
all buffers are flushed, and any resources associated with the open
file are returned to the operating system.

   For a typical sequence of calls see *note Creating a NetCDF Dataset:
(netcdf-f77)Creating.

   Fortran users take note: the netCDF Fortran 77 API consists of
wrappers around the functions of the netCDF C library. There is no
Fortran 77 code in netCDF except for these wrappers, and tests to
ensure that the wrappers work.

   The name of each Fortran function shows the outline of the C function
it wraps (for example, NF_CREATE is a wrapper around nc_create).

*note NF_CREATE:                     create a new netCDF file
(netcdf-f77)NF_CREATE.               
*note NF_DEF_DIM:                    define a dimension
(netcdf-f77)NF_DEF_DIM.

*note NF_CLOSE:                      close the netCDF file
(netcdf-f77)NF_CLOSE.                

3.1.3 Creating a NetCDF File in Fortran 90
------------------------------------------

Use NF90_CREATE to create a file. Then use NF90_DEF_DIM to define each
shared dimension. The data variables are then specified with
NF90_DEF_VAR. Any attributes are added with NF90_PUT_ATT. Finally, call
NF90_ENDDEF to tell the library that you are done defining the metadata,
and ready to start writing the data.

   After all data are written to the file, call NF90_CLOSE to ensure
that all buffers are flushed, and any resources associated with the
open file are returned to the operating system.

   For a typical sequence of calls see *note Creating a NetCDF Dataset:
(netcdf-f90)Creating.

   The netCDF Fortran 90 API calls the Fortran 77 API, which in turn
calls the netCDF C library.

   The name of each Fortran function shows the outline of the F77
function it wraps (for example, NF90_CREATE is a wrapper around
NF_CREATE). The F77 functions are, in turn, wrappers around the C
functions.

*note NF90_CREATE:                   create a netCDF file
(netcdf-f90)NF90_CREATE.

*note NF90_CLOSE:                    close the netCDF file
(netcdf-f90)NF90_CLOSE.              

3.1.4 Creating a NetCDF File in C++
-----------------------------------

Create an instance of the NcFile class to create a netCDF file. Use its
add_dim and add_var methods to add dimensions and variables. The
add_att method is available for both NcFile and NcVar.

   Use the NcError class to specify error handling behavior.

   For an example creating a simple file see *note simple_xy_wr.cpp::.
For a more complex example see *note pres_temp_4D_wr.cpp::.

3.2 Reading NetCDF Files of Known Structure
===========================================

To read a netCDF file of known structure, you need to:

`open the file'
     Specify the file name and whether you want read-write or read-only
     access.

`read variable or attribute data'
     Read the data or attributes of interest.

`close the file'
     Release all resources associated with this file.


   Use ncdump to learn the structure of a file (use the -h option). For
more information about ncdump see *note NetCDF Utilities:
(netcdf)NetCDF Utilities.

3.2.1 Numbering of NetCDF IDs
-----------------------------

In C, Fortran 77, and Fortran 90, netCDF objects are identified by an
integer: the ID. NetCDF functions use this ID to identify the object.
It's helpful for the programmer to understand these IDs.

   Open data files, dimensions, variables, and attributes are each
numbered independently, and are always numbered in the order in which
they were defined. (They also appear in this order in ncdump output.)
Numbering starts with 0 in C, and 1 in Fortran 77/90.

   For example, the first variable defined in a file will have an ID of
0 in C programs, and 1 in Fortran programs, and functions that apply to
a variable will need to know the ID of the variable you mean.

   (The numbering of files is an exception: file IDs are assigned by the
operating system when a file is opened, and are not permanently
associated with the file. IDs for netCDF dimensions and variables are
persistent, but deleting an attribute changes subsequent attribute
numbers.)

   Although netCDF refers to everything by an integer id (varid, dimid,
attnum), there are inquiry functions which, given a name, will return
an ID. For example, in the C API, nc_inq_varid will take a character
string (the name), and give back the ID of the variable of that name.
The variable ID is then used in subsequent calls (to read the data, for
example).

   Other inquiry functions exist to further describe the file. (*note
Inquiry Functions::).

3.3 Reading NetCDF Files of Unknown Structure
=============================================

Perhaps you would like to write your software to handle more general
cases, so that you don't have to adjust your source every time the grid
size changes, or a variable is added to the file.

   There are inquiry functions that let you find out everything you need
to know about a file. These functions contain "inq" or "INQ" in their
names.

   Using the inquiry functions, it is possible to write code that will
read and understand any netCDF file, whatever its contents. (For
example, ncdump does just that.)

3.3.1 Inquiry in C
------------------

First use nc_inq, which will tell you how many variables and global
attributes there are in the file.

   Start with global attribute 0, and proceed to natts - 1, the number
of global attributes minus one. The nc_inq_att function will tell you
the name, type, and length of each global attribute.

   Then start with dimid 0, and proceed to dimid ndims - 1, calling
nc_inq_dim. This will tell you the name and length of each dimension,
and whether it is unlimited.

   Then start with varid 0, and proceed to varid nvars - 1, calling
nc_inq_var. This will tell you the number of dimensions of this
variable, and their associated IDs. It will also get the name and type
of this variable, and whether there are any attributes attached. If
there are attributes attached, use the nc_inq_att function to get their
names, types, and lengths.

   (To read an attribute, use the appropriate nc_get_att_<TYPE>
function, like nc_get_att_int() to get the data from an attribute that
is an array of integers.)

   There are also functions that return an item's ID, given its name.
To find IDs from the names, use functions nc_inq_dimid, nc_inq_attnum,
and nc_inq_varid.

   For a typical sequence of calls to these functions see *note Reading
a netCDF Dataset with Unknown Names: (netcdf-c)Reading Unknown.

3.3.1.1 NULL Parameters in Inquiry Functions
............................................

With any of the C inquiry functions, a NULL pointer can be used to
ignore a return parameter. Consider the nc_inq function:

     EXTERNL int
     nc_inq(int ncid, int *ndimsp, int *nvarsp, int *nattsp, int *unlimdimidp);

   If you call this with NULL for the last three parameters, you can
learn the number of dimensions without bothering about the number of
variables, number of global attributes, and the ID of the unlimited
dimension.

   For further convenience, we provide functions like nc_inq_ndims,
which only finds the number of dimensions, exactly as if you had called
nc_inq, with NULLs in all parameters except ndimsp. (In fact, this is
just what the nc_inq_ndims functions does).

*note        Find number

3.4 Reading and Writing Subsets of Data
=======================================

Usually users are interested in reading or writing subsets of variables
in a netCDF data file. The netCDF APIs provide a variety of functions
for this purpose.

   In the simplest case, you will use the same type for both file and
in-memory storage, but in some cases you may wish to use different
types. For example, you might have a netCDF file that contains integer
data, and you wish to read it into floating-point storage, converting
the data as it is read. The same sort of type conversion can be done
when writing the data.

   To convert to a type while reading data, use the appropriate
nc_get_vara_<TYPE> or NF_GET_VARA_<TYPE> function. For example, the C
function nc_get_vara_float(), and the Fortran function NF_GET_VARA_REAL
will read netCDF data of any numeric type into a floating-point array,
automatically converting each element to the desired type.

   To convert from a type while writing data, use the appropriate
nc_put_vara_<TYPE> or NF_PUT_VARA_<TYPE> function. For example, the C
function nc_put_vara_float(), and the Fortran function NC_PUT_VARA_REAL
will write floating-point data into netCDF arrays, automatically
converting each element of the array to the type of the netCDF variable.

   The <TYPE> in the function name refers to the type of the in-memory
data, in both cases. They type of the file data is determined when the
netCDF variable is defined.

4 API Extensions Introduced with NetCDF-4
*****************************************

NetCDF-4 includes many advanced features. These features are only
available when working with files created in the netCDF format. (That
is, HDF5 files, created by netCDF, or simple-model HDF5 files).

4.1 Interoperability with HDF5
==============================

NetCDF-4 allows some interoperability with HDF5.

4.1.1 Reading and Editing NetCDF-4 Files with HDF5
--------------------------------------------------

The HDF5 Files produced by netCDF-4 are perfectly respectable HDF5
files, and can be read by any HDF5 application.

   NetCDF-4 relies on several new features of HDF5, including dimension
scales. The HDF5 dimension scales feature adds a bunch of attributes to
the HDF5 file to keep track of the dimension information.

   It is not just wrong, but wrong-headed, to modify these attributes
except with the HDF5 dimension scale API. If you do so, then you will
deserve what you get, which will be a mess.

   Additionally, netCDF stores some extra information for dimensions
without dimension scale information. (That is, a dimension without an
associated coordinate variable). So HDF5 users should not write data to
a netCDF-4 file which extends any unlimited dimension.

   Also there are some types allowed in HDF5, but not allowed in
netCDF-4 (for example the time type). Using any such type in a netCDF-4
file will cause the file to become unreadable to netCDF-4. So don't do
it.

   NetCDF-4 ignores all HDF5 references. Can't make head nor tail of
them. Also netCDF-4 assumes a strictly hierarchical group structure. No
looping, you weirdo!

   Attributes can be added (they must be one of the netCDF-4 types),
modified, or even deleted, in HDF5.

4.1.2 Reading and Editing HDF5 Files with NetCDF-4
--------------------------------------------------

Assuming a HDF5 file is written in accordance with the netCDF-4 rules
(i.e. no strange types, no looping groups), and assuming that *every*
dataset has a dimension scale attached to each dimension, the netCDF-4
API can be used to read and edit the file.

   In HDF5 (version 1.8.0 and later), dimension scales are (generally)
1D datasets, that hold dimension data. A multi-dimensional dataset can
then attach a dimension scale to any or all of its dimensions. For
example, a user might have 1D dimension scales for lat and lon, and a
2D dataset which has lat attached to the first dimension, and lon to
the second.

   Dimension scales are vital to netCDF-4, which uses shared
dimensions. If you want to read a HDF5 file with netCDF-4, it must use
dimension scales, and one dimension scale must be attached to each
dimension of every dataset in the file.

4.2 Multiple Unlimited Dimensions
=================================

With classic and 64-bit offset netCDF files, each variable may use at
most one unlimited dimension. With netCDF-4 format files, this
restriction is lifted.

   Simply define as many unlimited dimensions as you wish, and use them
in a variable. When data are written to that variable, the dimensions
will be expanded as needed.

4.3 Groups
==========

NetCDF-4 files can store attributes, variables, and dimensions in
hierarchical groups.

   This allows the user to create a structure much like a Unix file
system. In netCDF, each group gets an ncid. Opening or creating a file
returns the ncid for the root group (which is named "/"). Groups can be
added with the nc_def_grp function. Get the number of groups, and their
ncids, with the nc_inq_grps function.

   Dimensions are scoped such that they are visible to all child
groups. For example, you can define a dimension in the root group, and
use its dimension id when defining a variable in a sub-group.

   Attributes defined as NC_GLOBAL apply to the group, not the entire
file.

   The degenerate case, in which only the root group is used,
corresponds exactly with the classic data mode, before groups were
introduced.

4.4 Compound Types
==================

In netCDF-4 files it's possible to create a data type which corresponds
to a C struct. These are known as "compound" types (following HDF5
nomenclature).

   That is, a netCDF compound type is a data structure which contains an
arbitrary collection of other data types, including other compound
types.

   To define a new compound type, use nc_def_compound. Then call
nc_insert_compound for each type within the compound type.

   Read and write arrays of compound data with the nc_get_vara and
nc_put_vara functions. These functions were actually part of the
netCDF-2 API, brought out of semi-retirement to handle user-defined
types in netCDF-4.

4.5 Opaque Types
================

Store blobs of bits in opaque types. Create an opaque type with
nc_def_opaque. Read and write them with nc_get_vara/nc_put_vara.

4.6 Variable Length Arrays (VLEN)
=================================

Create a VLEN type to store variable length arrays of a known base
type. Use nc_def_vlen to define a VLEN type, read and write them with
nc_get_vara/nc_put_vara.

4.7 Strings
===========

Use the NC_STRING type to store arrays of strings. Read and write them
with nc_get_vara/nc_put_vara.

4.8 New Inquiry Functions
=========================

There are many new inquiry functions to allow a program to navigate a
completely unknown netCDF file.

   To find the number To find all the dimensions visible from a group,
use nc_inq_dimids.

4.9 Parallel I/O with NetCDF
============================

Parallel I/O allows many processes to read/write netCDF data at the
same time. Used properly, it allows users to overcome I/O bottlenecks
in high performance computing environments.

4.9.1 Parallel I/O Choices for NetCDF Users
-------------------------------------------

Parallel read-only access can be achieved netCDF files using the netCDF
C/Fortran library.  Each process can run a copy of the netCDF library
and open and read any subsets of the data in the file. This sort of
"fseek parallelism" will break down dramatically for any kind of
writing.

   There are two methods available to users for read/write parallel I/O
netCDF-4 or the parallel netCDF package from Argonne/Northwestern.
Unfortunately the two methods involve different APIs, and different
binary formats.

   For parallel read/write access to classic and 64-bit offset data
users must use the parallel-netcdf library from Argonne/Northwestern
University. This is not a Unidata software package, but was developed
using the Unidata netCDF C library as a starting point. For more
information see the parallel netcdf web site:
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/parallel-netcdf.

   For parallel read/write access to netCDF-4/HDF5 files users must use
the netCDF-4 API. The Argonne/Northwestern parallel netcdf package
cannot read netCDF-4/HDF5 files.

4.9.2 Parallel I/O with NetCDF-4
--------------------------------

NetCDF-4 provides access to HDF5 parallel I/O features for
netCDF-4/HDF5 files. NetCDF classic and 64-bit offset format may not be
opened or created for use with parallel I/O. (They may be opened and
created, but parallel I/O is not available.)

   A few functions have been added to the netCDF C API to handle
parallel I/O.  These functions are also available in the Fortran 90 and
Fortran 77 APIs.

4.9.2.1 Building NetCDF-4 for Parallel I/O
..........................................

You must build netCDF-4 properly to take advantage of parallel features.

   For parallel I/O HDF5 must be built with -enable-parallel.  Typically
the CC environment variable is set to mpicc. You must build HDF5 and
netCDF-4 with the same compiler and compiler options.

   The netCDF configure script will detect the parallel capability of
HDF5 and build the netCDF-4 parallel I/O features automatically. No
configure options to the netcdf configure are required. If the Fortran
APIs are desired set environmental variable FC to mpif90 (or some local
variant.)

4.9.2.2 Opening/Creating Files for Parallel I/O
...............................................

The nc_open_par and nc_create_par functions are used to create/open a
netCDF file with the C API. (Or use nf_open_par/nf_create_par from
Fortran 77).

   For Fortran 90 users the nf90_open and nf90_create calls have been
modified to permit parallel I/O files to be opened/created using
optional parameters comm and info.

   The parallel access associated with these functions is not a
characteristic of the data file, but the way it was opened.

4.9.2.3 Collective/Independent Access
.....................................

Parallel file access is either collective (all processors must
participate) or independent (any processor may access the data without
waiting for others).

   All netCDF metadata writing operations are collective. That is, all
creation of groups, types, variables, dimensions, or attributes.

   Data reads and writes (ex. calls to nc_put_vara_int and
nc_get_vara_int) may be independent (the default) or collective. To
make writes to a variable collective, call the nc_var_par_access
function (or nf_var_par_access for Fortran 77 users, or
nf90_var_par_access for Fortran 90 users).

   The example program below demonstrates simple parallel writing and
reading of a netCDF file.

4.9.3 simple_xy_par_wr.c and simple_xy_par_rd.c
-----------------------------------------------

For this release, only a Fortran 90 language version of this example is
provided. Other APIs will be demonstrated in examples in future
releases.

   In the simple_xy_par_wr example program an num_procs x num_procs
array is written to the disk, where num_proc is the number of
processors on which this program is run. Each processor writes one row
of length num_proc.

   In the simple_xy_par_rd program the file is read in, and each
processor expects to read in a row with its own MPI rank stored. (The
read program must be run on no more processors than were used to create
the file.)

4.10 The Future of NetCDF
=========================

NetCDF continues under active development at Unidata (see
`http://www.unidata.ucar.edu').

   The next few releases of netCDF will include:
  1. A new C++ API which has better error handling and handles netCDF-4
     advanced features, such as groups and compound types.

  2. Remote access to files stored on a DAP server.

  3. Bundled packaging with udunits and other useful tools.

  4. More documentation, more examples, more tests, and more fun!


5 NetCDF-4 Examples
*******************

Any existing netCDF applications can be converted to generate
netCDF-4/HDF5 files. Simply change the file creation call to include
the correct mode flag.

   For example, in one of the C examples which write a data file, change
the nc_create call so that NC_NETCDF4 is one of the flags set on the
create.

   The corresponding read example will work without modification; netCDF
will notice that the file is a NetCDF-4/HDF5 file, and will read it
automatically, just as if it were a netCDF classic format file.

   In the example in this section we show some of the advanced features
of netCDF-4. More examples will be added in future releases.

5.1 The simple_nc4 Example
==========================

This example, like the simple_xy netCDF-3 example above, is an overly
simplified example which demonstrates how to use groups in a netCDF-4
file.

   This example is only available in C for this version of netCDF-4. The
example creates and then reads the file "simple_nc4.nc."

   The simple_xy.nc data file contains two dimensions, "x" and "y", two
groups, "grp1" and "grp2", and two data variables, one in each group,
both named: "data." One data variable is an unsigned 64-bit integer,
the other a user-defined compound type.

   The example program simple_nc4_wr.c creates the example data file
simple_nc4.nc. The example program simple_nc4_rd.c reads the data file.

5.1.1 simple_nc4_wr.c and simple_nc4_rd.c
-----------------------------------------

For this release, only a C language version of this example is
provided. Other APIs will be demonstrated in examples in future
releases.

5.1.1.1 simple_nc4_wr.c

     /* This is part of the netCDF-4 package. Copyright 2007 University

        for conditions of use.

        This is a very simple example which demonstrates some of the
        new features of netCDF-4.0.

        We create two shared dimensions, "x" and "y", in a parent group,
        and some netCDF variables in different subgroups. The variables
        will include a compound and an enum type, as well as some of the
        new atomic types, like the unsigned 64-bit integer.

        This example demonstrates the netCDF-4 C API. This is part of the
        netCDF tutorial, which can be found at:
        http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf-tutorial.html

        To understand this example program, users should have a good
        understanding of the netCDF-3 API. See the example program
        simple_xy_wr.c for a netCDF-3 example.

5.2 The simple_xy_nc4 Example
=============================

This example, like the simple_xy netCDF-3 example above, is an overly
simplified example. It is based on the simple_xy example, but used data
chunking, compression, and the fletcher32 filter.

   (These are all HDF5 features. For more information see
http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/).

   This example is not yet available in C++. We hope to have the C++
example in a future release of netCDF.

   The example creates and then reads the file "simple_xy_nc4.nc."

   The example program simple_xy_nc4_wr.c creates the example data file
simple_xy_nc4.nc. The example program simple_xy_nc4_rd.c reads the data
file.

5.2.1 simple_xy_nc4_wr.c and simple_xy_nc4_rd.c
-----------------------------------------------

This is just like the simple_xy example, but with chunking and variable
compression.

        example, but whch uses netCDF-4 features, such as
        compression. Please see the simple_xy example to learn more about
        the netCDF-3 API.

        Like simple_xy_wr.c, this program writes a 2D netCDF variable
        (called "data") and fills it with sample data.  It has two
        dimensions, "x" and "y".
