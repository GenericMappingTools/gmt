1 Use of the NetCDF Library
***************************

You can use the netCDF library without knowing about all of the netCDF
interface. If you are creating a netCDF dataset, only a handful of
routines are required to define the necessary dimensions, variables,
and attributes, and to write the data to the netCDF dataset. (Even less
are needed if you use the ncgen utility to create the dataset before
running a program using netCDF library calls to write data. *Note
ncgen: (netcdf)ncgen.)  Similarly, if you are writing software to
access data stored in a particular netCDF object, only a small subset
of the netCDF library is required to open the netCDF dataset and access
the data. Authors of generic applications that access arbitrary netCDF
datasets need to be familiar with more of the netCDF library.

   In this chapter we provide templates of common sequences of netCDF
calls needed for common uses. For clarity we present only the names of
routines; omit declarations and error checking; omit the type-specific
suffixes of routine names for variables and attributes; indent
statements that are typically invoked multiple times; and use ... to
represent arbitrary sequences of other statements. Full parameter lists
are described in later chapters.

1.1 Creating a NetCDF Dataset
=============================

Here is a typical sequence of netCDF calls used to create a new netCDF
dataset:

          NF90_CREATE           ! create netCDF dataset: enter define mode
               ...
             NF90_DEF_DIM       ! define dimensions: from name and length
               ...
             NF90_DEF_VAR       ! define variables: from name, type, dims
               ...
             NF90_PUT_ATT       ! assign attribute values
               ...
          NF90_ENDDEF           ! end definitions: leave define mode
               ...
             NF90_PUT_VAR       ! provide values for variable
               ...
          NF90_CLOSE            ! close: save new netCDF dataset

   Only one call is needed to create a netCDF dataset, at which point
you will be in the first of two netCDF modes. When accessing an open
netCDF dataset, it is either in define mode or data mode. In define
mode, you can create dimensions, variables, and new attributes, but you
cannot read or write variable data. In data mode, you can access data
and change existing attributes, but you are not permitted to create new
dimensions, variables, or attributes.

   One call to NF90_DEF_DIM is needed for each dimension created.
Similarly, one call to NF90_DEF_VAR is needed for each variable
creation, and one call to a member of the NF90_PUT_ATT family is needed
for each attribute defined and assigned a value. To leave define mode
and enter data mode, call NF90_ENDDEF.

   Once in data mode, you can add new data to variables, change old
values, and change values of existing attributes (so long as the
attribute changes do not require more storage space). Data of all types
is written to a netCDF variable using the NF90_PUT_VAR subroutine.
Single values, arrays, or array sections may be supplied to
NF90_PUT_VAR; optional arguments allow the writing of subsampled or
mapped portions of the variable. (Subsampled and mapped access are
general forms of data access that are explained later.)

   Finally, you should explicitly close all netCDF datasets that have
been opened for writing by calling NF90_CLOSE. By default, access to
the file system is buffered by the netCDF library. If a program
terminates abnormally with netCDF datasets open for writing, your most
recent modifications may be lost. This default buffering of data is
disabled by setting the NF90_SHARE flag when opening the dataset. But
even if this flag is set, changes to attribute values or changes made
in define mode are not written out until NF90_SYNC or NF90_CLOSE is
called.

1.2 Reading a NetCDF Dataset with Known Names
=============================================

Here we consider the case where you know the names of not only the
netCDF datasets, but also the names of their dimensions, variables, and
attributes. (Otherwise you would have to do "inquire" calls.) The order
of typical C calls to read data from those variables in a netCDF
dataset is:

          NF90_OPEN               ! open existing netCDF dataset
               ...
             NF90_INQ_DIMID       ! get dimension IDs
               ...
             NF90_INQ_VARID       ! get variable IDs
               ...
             NF90_GET_ATT         ! get attribute values
               ...
             NF90_GET_VAR         ! get values of variables
               ...
          NF90_CLOSE              ! close netCDF dataset

   First, a single call opens the netCDF dataset, given the dataset
name, and returns a netCDF ID that is used to refer to the open netCDF
dataset in all subsequent calls.

   Next, a call to NF90_INQ_DIMID for each dimension of interest gets
the dimension ID from the dimension name. Similarly, each required
variable ID is determined from its name by a call to NF90_INQ_VARID.
Once variable IDs are known, variable attribute values can be retrieved
using the netCDF ID, the variable ID, and the desired attribute name as
input to NF90_GET_ATT for each desired attribute. Variable data values
can be directly accessed from the netCDF dataset with calls to
NF90_GET_VAR.

   Finally, the netCDF dataset is closed with NF90_CLOSE. There is no
need to close a dataset open only for reading.

1.3 Reading a netCDF Dataset with Unknown Names
===============================================

It is possible to write programs (e.g., generic software) which do such
things as processing every variable, without needing to know in advance
the names of these variables. Similarly, the names of dimensions and
attributes may be unknown.

   Names and other information about netCDF objects may be obtained from
netCDF datasets by calling inquire functions. These return information
about a whole netCDF dataset, a dimension, a variable, or an attribute.
The following template illustrates how they are used:

          NF90_OPEN                 ! open existing netCDF dataset
            ...
          NF90_INQUIRE              ! find out what is in it
               ...
             NF90_INQUIRE_DIMENSION ! get dimension names, lengths
               ...
             NF90_INQUIRE_VARIABLE  ! get variable names, types, shapes
                  ...
                NF90_INQ_ATTNAME    ! get attribute names
                  ...
                NF90_INQUIRE_ATTRIBUTE ! get other attribute information
                  ...
                NF90_GET_ATT        ! get attribute values
                  ...
             NF90_GET_VAR           ! get values of variables
               ...
          NF90_CLOSE                ! close netCDF dataset

   As in the previous example, a single call opens the existing netCDF
dataset, returning a netCDF ID. This netCDF ID is given to the
NF90_INQUIRE routine, which returns the number of dimensions, the
number of variables, the number of global attributes, and the ID of the
unlimited dimension, if there is one.

   All the inquire functions are inexpensive to use and require no I/O,
since the information they provide is stored in memory when a netCDF
dataset is first opened.

   Dimension IDs use consecutive integers, beginning at 1. Also
dimensions, once created, cannot be deleted. Therefore, knowing the
number of dimension IDs in a netCDF dataset means knowing all the
dimension IDs: they are the integers 1, 2, 3, ...up to the number of
dimensions. For each dimension ID, a call to the inquire function
NF90_INQUIRE_DIMENSION returns the dimension name and length.

   Variable IDs are also assigned from consecutive integers 1, 2, 3,
... up to the number of variables. These can be used in
NF90_INQUIRE_VARIABLE calls to find out the names, types, shapes, and
the number of attributes assigned to each variable.

   Once the number of attributes for a variable is known, successive
calls to NF90_INQ_ATTNAME return the name for each attribute given the
netCDF ID, variable ID, and attribute number. Armed with the attribute
name, a call to NF90_INQUIRE_ATTRIBUTE returns its type and length.
Given the type and length, you can allocate enough space to hold the
attribute values. Then a call to NF90_GET_ATT returns the attribute
values.

   Once the IDs and shapes of netCDF variables are known, data values
can be accessed by calling NF90_GET_VAR.

1.4 Writing Data in an Existing NetCDF Dataset
==============================================

With write access to an existing netCDF dataset, you can overwrite data
values in existing variables or append more data to record variables
along the unlimited (record) dimension. To append more data to
non-record variables requires changing the shape of such variables,
which means creating a new netCDF dataset, defining new variables with
the desired shape, and copying data. The netCDF data model was not
designed to make such "schema changes" efficient or easy, so it is best
to specify the shapes of variables correctly when you create a netCDF
dataset, and to anticipate which variables will later grow by using the
unlimited dimension in their definition.

   The following code template lists a typical sequence of calls to
overwrite some existing values and add some new records to record
variables in an existing netCDF dataset with known variable names:

          NF90_OPEN             ! open existing netCDF dataset
            ...
            NF90_INQ_VARID      ! get variable IDs
            ...
            NF90_PUT_VAR        ! provide new values for variables, if any
            ...
            NF90_PUT_ATT        ! provide new values for attributes, if any
              ...
          NF90_CLOSE            ! close netCDF dataset

   A netCDF dataset is first opened by the NF90_OPEN call. This call
puts the open dataset in data mode, which means existing data values
can be accessed and changed, existing attributes can be changed, but no
new dimensions, variables, or attributes can be added.

   Next, calls to NF90_INQ_VARID get the variable ID from the name, for
each variable you want to write. Then each call to NF90_PUT_VAR writes
data into a specified variable, either a single value at a time, or a
whole set of values at a time, depending on which variant of the
interface is used. The calls used to overwrite values of non-record
variables are the same as are used to overwrite values of record
variables or append new data to record variables. The difference is
that, with record variables, the record dimension is extended by
writing values that don't yet exist in the dataset. This extends all
record variables at once, writing "fill values" for record variables
for which the data has not yet been written (but *note Fill Values:: to
specify different behavior).

   Calls to NF90_PUT_ATT may be used to change the values of existing
attributes, although data that changes after a file is created is
typically stored in variables rather than attributes.

   Finally, you should explicitly close any netCDF datasets into which
data has been written by calling NF90_CLOSE before program termination.
Otherwise, modifications to the dataset may be lost.

1.5 Adding New Dimensions, Variables, Attributes
================================================

An existing netCDF dataset can be extensively altered. New dimensions,
variables, and attributes can be added or existing ones renamed, and
existing attributes can be deleted. Existing dimensions, variables, and
attributes can be renamed. The following code template lists a typical
sequence of calls to add new netCDF components to an existing dataset:

          NF90_OPEN             ! open existing netCDF dataset
            ...
          NF90_REDEF            ! put it into define mode
              ...
            NF90_DEF_DIM        ! define additional dimensions (if any)
              ...
            NF90_DEF_VAR        ! define additional variables (if any)
              ...
            NF90_PUT_ATT        ! define other attributes (if any)
              ...
          NF90_ENDDEF           ! check definitions, leave define mode
              ...
            NF90_PUT_VAR        ! provide new variable values
              ...
          NF90_CLOSE            ! close netCDF dataset

   A netCDF dataset is first opened by the NF90_OPEN call. This call
puts the open dataset in data mode, which means existing data values
can be accessed and changed, existing attributes can be changed (so
long as they do not grow), but nothing can be added. To add new netCDF
dimensions, variables, or attributes you must enter define mode, by
calling NF90_REDEF. In define mode, call NF90_DEF_DIM to define new
dimensions, NF90_DEF_VAR to define new variables, and NF90_PUT_ATT to
assign new attributes to variables or enlarge old attributes.

   You can leave define mode and reenter data mode, checking all the new
definitions for consistency and committing the changes to disk, by
calling NF90_ENDDEF. If you do not wish to reenter data mode, just call
NF90_CLOSE, which will have the effect of first calling NF90_ENDDEF.

   Until the NF90_ENDDEF call, you may back out of all the redefinitions
made in define mode and restore the previous state of the netCDF
dataset by calling NF90_ABORT. You may also use the NF90_ABORT call to
restore the netCDF dataset to a consistent state if the call to
NF90_ENDDEF fails. If you have called NF90_CLOSE from definition mode
and the implied call to NF90_ENDDEF fails, NF90_ABORT will
automatically be called to close the netCDF dataset and leave it in its
previous consistent state (before you entered define mode).

   At most one process should have a netCDF dataset open for writing at
one time. The library is designed to provide limited support for
multiple concurrent readers with one writer, via disciplined use of the
NF90_SYNC function and the NF90_SHARE flag. If a writer makes changes
in define mode, such as the addition of new variables, dimensions, or
attributes, some means external to the library is necessary to prevent
readers from making concurrent accesses and to inform readers to call
NF90_SYNC before the next access.

1.6 Error Handling
==================

The netCDF library provides the facilities needed to handle errors in a
flexible way. Each netCDF function returns an integer status value. If
the returned status value indicates an error, you may handle it in any
way desired, from printing an associated error message and exiting to
ignoring the error indication and proceeding (not recommended!). For
simplicity, the examples in this guide check the error status and call
a separate function to handle any errors.

   The NF90_STRERROR function is available to convert a returned integer
error status into an error message string.

   Occasionally, low-level I/O errors may occur in a layer below the
netCDF library. For example, if a write operation causes you to exceed
disk quotas or to attempt to write to a device that is no longer
available, you may get an error from a layer below the netCDF library,
but the resulting write error will still be reflected in the returned
status value.

1.7 Compiling and Linking with the NetCDF Library
=================================================

Details of how to compile and link a program that uses the netCDF C or
Fortran interfaces differ, depending on the operating system, the
available compilers, and where the netCDF library and include files are
installed.

   Every Fortran 90 procedure or module which references netCDF
constants or procedures must have access to the module information
created when the netCDF module was compiled. The suffix for this file
is "MOD" (or sometimes "mod").

   Most F90 compilers allow the user to specify the location of .MOD
files, usually with the -I flag. (Some compilers, like absoft, use -p
instead).

     f90 -c -I/usr/local/include mymodule.f90

   Starting with version 3.6.2, another method of building the netCDF
fortran libraries becomes available. With the -enable-separate-fortran
option to configure, the user can specify that the C library should not
contain the fortran functions. In these cases an additional library,
libnetcdff.a (not the extra "f") will be built. This library contains
the fortran functions.

   For more information about configure options, *Note Specifying the
Environment for Building: (netcdf-install)Specifying the Environment
for Building.

   Building separate fortran libraries is required for shared library
builds, but is not done, by default, for static library builds.

   When linking fortran programs without a separate fortran library,
programs must link to the netCDF library like this:

     f90 -o myprogram myprogram.o -L/usr/local/netcdf/lib -lnetcdf

2.1 Datasets Introduction
=========================

This chapter presents the interfaces of the netCDF functions that deal
with a netCDF dataset or the whole netCDF library.

   A netCDF dataset that has not yet been opened can only be referred to
by its dataset name. Once a netCDF dataset is opened, it is referred to
by a netCDF ID, which is a small nonnegative integer returned when you
create or open the dataset. A netCDF ID is much like a file descriptor
in C or a logical unit number in FORTRAN. In any single program, the
netCDF IDs of distinct open netCDF datasets are distinct. A single
netCDF dataset may be opened multiple times and will then have multiple
distinct netCDF IDs; however at most one of the open instances of a
single netCDF dataset should permit writing. When an open netCDF
dataset is closed, the ID is no longer associated with a netCDF dataset.

   Functions that deal with the netCDF library include:
   * Get version of library.

   * Get error message corresponding to a returned error code.

   The operations supported on a netCDF dataset as a single object are:
   * Create, given dataset name and whether to overwrite or not.

   * Open for access, given dataset name and read or write intent.

   * Put into define mode, to add dimensions, variables, or attributes.

   * Take out of define mode, checking consistency of additions.

   * Close, writing to disk if required.

   * Inquire about the number of dimensions, number of variables,
     number of global attributes, and ID of the unlimited dimension, if
     any.

   * Synchronize to disk to make sure it is current.

   * Set and unset nofill mode for optimized sequential writes.

   * After a summary of conventions used in describing the netCDF
     interfaces, the rest of this chapter presents a detailed
     description of the interfaces for these operations.

2.2 NetCDF Library Interface Descriptions
=========================================

Each interface description for a particular netCDF function in this and
later chapters contains:

   * a description of the purpose of the function;

   * a Fortran 90 interface block that presents the type and order of
     the formal parameters to the function;

   * a description of each formal parameter in the C interface;

   * a list of possible error conditions; and

   * an example of a Fortran 90 program fragment calling the netCDF
     function (and perhaps other netCDF functions).

   The examples follow a simple convention for error handling, always
checking the error status returned from each netCDF function call and
calling a handle_error function in case an error was detected. For an
example of such a function, see Section 5.2 "Get error message
corresponding to error status: nf90_strerror".

2.3 NF90_STRERROR
=================

The function NF90_STRERROR returns a static reference to an error
message string corresponding to an integer netCDF error status or to a
system error number, presumably returned by a previous call to some
other netCDF function. The list of netCDF error status codes is
available in the appropriate include file for each language binding.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_strerror(ncerr)
        integer, intent( in) :: ncerr
        character(len = 80)  :: nf90_strerror

`NCERR'
     An error status that might have been returned from a previous call
     to some netCDF function.

Errors
======

If you provide an invalid integer error status that does not correspond
to any netCDF error message or or to any system error message (as
understood by the system strerror function), NF90_STRERROR returns a
string indicating that there is no such error status.

Example
=======

Here is an example of a simple error handling function that uses
NF90_STRERROR to print the error message corresponding to the netCDF
error status returned from any netCDF function call and then exit:

      subroutine handle_err(status)
        integer, intent ( in) :: status

        if(status /= nf90_noerr) then
          print *, trim(nf90_strerror(status))
          stop "Stopped"
        end if
      end subroutine handle_err

2.4 Get netCDF library version: NF90_INQ_LIBVERS
================================================

The function NF90_INQ_LIBVERS returns a string identifying the version
of the netCDF library, and when it was built.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_inq_libvers()
        character(len = 80) :: nf90_inq_libvers

Errors
======

This function takes no arguments, and returns no error status.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nf90_inq_libvers to print the version of the
netCDF library with which the program is linked:

      print *, trim(nf90_inq_libvers())


File: netcdf-f90.info,  Node: NF90_CREATE,  Next: NF90_OPEN,  Prev: NF90_INQ_LIBVERS,  Up: Datasets

2.5 NF90_CREATE
===============

This function creates a new netCDF dataset, returning a netCDF ID that
can subsequently be used to refer to the netCDF dataset in other netCDF
function calls. The new netCDF dataset opened for write access and
placed in define mode, ready for you to add dimensions, variables, and
attributes.

   A creation mode flag specifies whether to overwrite any existing
dataset with the same name and whether access to the dataset is shared.

Usage
=====

       function nf90_create(path, cmode, ncid, initialsize, bufrsize, cache_size, &
            cache_nelems, cache_preemption, comm, info)
         implicit none
         character (len = *), intent(in) :: path
         integer, intent(in) :: cmode
         integer, intent(out) :: ncid
         integer, optional, intent(in) :: initialsize
         integer, optional, intent(inout) :: bufrsize
         integer, optional, intent(in) :: cache_size, cache_nelems
         real, optional, intent(in) :: cache_preemption
         integer, optional, intent(in) :: comm, info
         integer :: nf90_create

`path'
     The file name of the new netCDF dataset.

`cmode'
     The creation mode flag. The following flags are available:
     NF90_NOCLOBBER, NF90_SHARE, NF90_64BIT_OFFSET, NF90_HDF5, and
     NF90_CLASSIC_MODEL.

     A zero value (defined for convenience as NF90_CLOBBER) specifies
     the default behavior: overwrite any existing dataset with the same
     file name and buffer and cache accesses for efficiency. The
     dataset will be in netCDF classic format. *Note NetCDF Classic
     Format Limitations: (netcdf)NetCDF Classic Format Limitations.

     Setting NF90_NOCLOBBER means you do not want to clobber
     (overwrite) an existing dataset; an error (NF90_EEXIST) is
     returned if the specified dataset already exists.

     The NF90_SHARE flag is appropriate when one process may be writing
     the dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
     concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
     caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
     sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially
     may see some performance improvement by setting the NF90_SHARE
     flag. (This only applies to netCDF-3 classic or 64-bit offset
     files.)

     Setting NF90_64BIT_OFFSET causes netCDF to create a 64-bit offset
     format file, instead of a netCDF classic format file. The 64-bit
     offset format imposes far fewer restrictions on very large (i.e.
     over 2 GB) data files. *Note Large File Support: (netcdf)Large
     File Support.

     Setting the NF90_HDF5 flag causes netCDF to create a netCDF-4/HDF5
     format output file.

     Oring the NF90_CLASSIC_MODEL flag with the NF90_HDF5 flag causes
     the resulting netCDF-4/HDF5 file to restrict itself to the classic
     model - none of the new netCDF-4 data model features, such as
     groups or user-defined types, are allowed in such a file.

`ncid'
     Returned netCDF ID.

   The following optional arguments allow additional performance tuning.

`initialsize'
     The initial size of the file (in bytes) at creation time. A value
     of 0 causes the file size to be computed when nf90_enddef is
     called. This is ignored for NetCDF-4/HDF5 files.

`bufrsize'
     Controls a space versus time trade-off, memory allocated in the
     netcdf library versus number of system calls. Because of internal
     requirements, the value may not be set to exactly the value
     requested. The actual value chosen is returned.

     The library chooses a system-dependent default value if
     NF90_SIZEHINT_DEFAULT is supplied as input. If the "preferred I/O
     block size" is available from the stat() system call as member
     st_blksize this value is used. Lacking that, twice the system
     pagesize is used. Lacking a call to discover the system pagesize,
     the default bufrsize is set to 8192 bytes.

     The bufrsize is a property of a given open netcdf descriptor ncid,
     it is not a persistent property of the netcdf dataset.

     This is ignored for NetCDF-4/HDF5 files.

`cache_size'
     If the cache_size is provided when creating a netCDF-4/HDF5 file,
     it will be used instead of the default (32000000) as the size, in
     bytes, of the HDF5 chunk cache.

`cache_nelems'
     If cache_nelems is provided when creating a netCDF-4/HDF5 file, it
     will be used instead of the default (1000) as the maximum number of
     elements in the HDF5 chunk cache.

`cache_premtion'
     If cache_preemption is provided when creating a netCDF-4/HDF5
     file, it will be used instead of the default (0.75) as the
     preemption value for the HDF5 chunk cache.

`comm'
     If the comm and info parameters are provided the file is created
     and opened for parallel I/O. Set the comm parameter to the MPI
     communicator (of type MPI_Comm). If this parameter is provided the
     info parameter must also be provided.

`info'
     If the comm and info parameters are provided the file is created
     and opened for parallel I/O. Set the comm parameter to the MPI
     information value (of type MPI_Info). If this parameter is
     provided the comm parameter must also be provided.


Errors
======

NF90_CREATE returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred. Possible
causes of errors include:
   * Passing a dataset name that includes a directory that does not
     exist.

   * Specifying a dataset name of a file that exists and also specifying
     NF90_NOCLOBBER.

   * Specifying a meaningless value for the creation mode.

   * Attempting to create a netCDF dataset in a directory where you
     don't have permission to create files.

Example
=======

In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo.nc; we want the
dataset to be created in the current directory only if a dataset with
that name does not already exist:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status
      ...
      status = nf90_create(path = "foo.nc", cmode = nf90_noclobber, ncid = ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)


File: netcdf-f90.info,  Node: NF90_OPEN,  Next: NF90_REDEF,  Prev: NF90_CREATE,  Up: Datasets

2.6 NF90_OPEN
=============

The function NF90_OPEN opens an existing netCDF dataset for access.

Usage
=====

       function nf90_open(path, mode, ncid, bufrsize, cache_size, cache_nelems, &
                          cache_preemption, comm, info)
         implicit none
         character (len = *), intent(in) :: path
         integer, intent(in) :: mode
         integer, intent(out) :: ncid
         integer, optional, intent(inout) :: bufrsize
         integer, optional, intent(in) :: cache_size, cache_nelems
         real, optional, intent(in) :: cache_preemption
         integer, optional, intent(in) :: comm, info
         integer :: nf90_open

`path'
     File name for netCDF dataset to be opened.  This may be an OPeNDAP
     URL if DAP support is enabled.

`mode'
     A zero value (or NF90_NOWRITE) specifies the default behavior:
     open the dataset with read-only access, buffering and caching
     accesses for efficiency

     Otherwise, the open mode is NF90_WRITE, NF90_SHARE, or
     NF90_WRITE|NF90_SHARE. Setting the NF90_WRITE flag opens the
     dataset with read-write access. ("Writing" means any kind of
     change to the dataset, including appending or changing data,
     adding or renaming dimensions, variables, and attributes, or
     deleting attributes.) The NF90_SHARE flag is appropriate when one
     process may be writing the dataset and one or more other processes
     reading the dataset concurrently (note that this is not the same
     as parallel I/O); it means that dataset accesses are not buffered
     and caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized
     for sequential access, programs that do not access data
     sequentially may see some performance improvement by setting the
     NF90_SHARE flag.

`ncid'
     Returned netCDF ID.

   The following optional argument allows additional performance tuning.

`bufrsize'
     This parameter applies only when opening classic format or 64-bit
     offset files. It is ignored for netCDF-4/HDF5 files.

     It Controls a space versus time trade-off, memory allocated in the
     netcdf library versus number of system calls. Because of internal
     requirements, the value may not be set to exactly the value
     requested. The actual value chosen is returned.

     The library chooses a system-dependent default value if
     NF90_SIZEHINT_DEFAULT is supplied as input. If the "preferred I/O
     block size" is available from the stat() system call as member
     st_blksize this value is used. Lacking that, twice the system
     pagesize is used. Lacking a call to discover the system pagesize,
     the default bufrsize is set to 8192 bytes.

     The bufrsize is a property of a given open netcdf descriptor ncid,
     it is not a persistent property of the netcdf dataset.

`cache_size'
     If the cache_size is provided when opening a netCDF-4/HDF5 file, it
     will be used instead of the default (32000000) as the size, in
     bytes, of the HDF5 chunk cache.

`cache_nelems'
     If cache_nelems is provided when opening a netCDF-4/HDF5 file, it
     will be used instead of the default (1000) as the maximum number of
     elements in the HDF5 chunk cache.

`cache_premtion'
     If cache_preemption is provided when opening a netCDF-4/HDF5 file,
     it will be used instead of the default (0.75) as the preemption
     value for the HDF5 chunk cache.

`comm'
     If the comm and info parameters are provided the file is opened for
     parallel I/O. Set the comm parameter to the MPI communicator (of
     type MPI_Comm). If this parameter is provided the info parameter
     must also be provided.

`info'
     If the comm and info parameters are provided the file is opened for
     parallel I/O. Set the comm parameter to the MPI information value
     (of type MPI_Info). If this parameter is provided the comm
     parameter must also be provided.


Errors
======

NF90_OPEN returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The specified netCDF dataset does not exist.

   * A meaningless mode was specified.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_OPEN to open an existing netCDF dataset
named foo.nc for read-only, non-shared access:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status
      ...
      status = nf90_open(path = "foo.nc", mode = nf90_nowrite, ncid = ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_OPEN to open an existing netCDF dataset
for parallel I/O access. (Note the use of the comm and info
parameters). This example is from test program
nf_test/f90tst_parallel.f90.

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status
      ...
       ! Reopen the file.
       call handle_err(nf90_open(FILE_NAME, nf90_nowrite, ncid, comm = MPI_COMM_WORLD, &
            info = MPI_INFO_NULL))

2.7 NF90_REDEF
==============

The function NF90_REDEF puts an open netCDF dataset into define mode, so
dimensions, variables, and attributes can be added or renamed and
attributes can be deleted.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_redef(ncid)
        integer, intent( in) :: ncid
        integer              :: nf90_redef

`ncid'
     netCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

Errors
======

NF90_REDEF returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The specified netCDF dataset is already in define mode.

   * The specified netCDF dataset was opened for read-only.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_REDEF to open an existing netCDF dataset
named foo.nc and put it into define mode:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_write, ncid) ! Open dataset
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_redef(ncid)                       ! Put the file in define mode
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)

2.8 NF90_ENDDEF
===============

The function NF90_ENDDEF takes an open netCDF dataset out of define
mode. The changes made to the netCDF dataset while it was in define
mode are checked and committed to disk if no problems occurred.
Non-record variables may be initialized to a "fill value" as well
(*note NF90_SET_FILL::). The netCDF dataset is then placed in data
mode, so variable data can be read or written.

   This call may involve copying data under some circumstances. For a
more extensive discussion *Note File Structure and Performance:
(netcdf)File Structure and Performance.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_enddef(ncid, h_minfree, v_align, v_minfree, r_align)
        integer,           intent( in) :: ncid
        integer, optional, intent( in) :: h_minfree, v_align, v_minfree, r_align
        integer                        :: nf90_enddef

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

   The following arguments allow additional performance tuning. Note:
these arguments expose internals of the netcdf version 1 file format,
and may not be available in future netcdf implementations.

   The current netcdf file format has three sections: the "header"
section, the data section for fixed size variables, and the data
section for variables which have an unlimited dimension (record
variables). The header begins at the beginning of the file. The index
(offset) of the beginning of the other two sections is contained in the
header. Typically, there is no space between the sections. This causes
copying overhead to accrue if one wishes to change the size of the
sections, as may happen when changing the names of things, text
attribute values, adding attributes or adding variables. Also, for
buffered i/o, there may be advantages to aligning sections in certain
ways.

   The minfree parameters allow one to control costs of future calls to
nf90_redef or nf90_enddef by requesting that some space be available at
the end of the section. The default value for both h_minfree and
v_minfree is 0.

   The align parameters allow one to set the alignment of the beginning
of the corresponding sections. The beginning of the section is rounded
up to an index which is a multiple of the align parameter. The flag
value NF90_ALIGN_CHUNK tells the library to use the bufrsize (see
above) as the align parameter. The default value for both v_align and
r_align is 4 bytes.

`h_minfree'
     Size of the pad (in bytes) at the end of the "header" section.

`v_minfree'
     Size of the pad (in bytes) at the end of the data section for fixed
     size variables.

`v_align'
     The alignment of the beginning of the data section for fixed size
     variables.

`r_align'
     The alignment of the beginning of the data section for variables
     which have an unlimited dimension (record variables).


Errors
======

NF90_ENDDEF returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The specified netCDF dataset is not in define mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * The size of one or more variables exceed the size constraints for
     whichever variant of the file format is in use).  *Note Large File
     Support: (netcdf)Large File Support.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_ENDDEF to finish the definitions of a new
netCDF dataset named foo.nc and put it into data mode:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status
      ...
      status = nf90_create("foo.nc", nf90_noclobber, ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...  !  create dimensions, variables, attributes
      status = nf90_enddef(ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)


File: netcdf-f90.info,  Node: NF90_CLOSE,  Next: NF90_INQUIRE Family,  Prev: NF90_ENDDEF,  Up: Datasets

2.9 NF90_CLOSE
==============

The function NF90_CLOSE closes an open netCDF dataset. If the dataset is
in define mode, NF90_ENDDEF will be called before closing. (In this
case, if NF90_ENDDEF returns an error, NF90_ABORT will automatically be
called to restore the dataset to the consistent state before define
mode was last entered.) After an open netCDF dataset is closed, its
netCDF ID may be reassigned to the next netCDF dataset that is opened
or created.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_close(ncid)
        integer, intent( in) :: ncid
        integer              :: nf90_close

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

Errors
======

NF90_CLOSE returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * Define mode was entered and the automatic call made to NF90_ENDDEF
     failed.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_CLOSE to finish the definitions of a new
netCDF dataset named foo.nc and release its netCDF ID:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status
      ...
      status = nf90_create("foo.nc", nf90_noclobber, ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...  !  create dimensions, variables, attributes
      status = nf90_close(ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)

2.10 NF90_INQUIRE Family
========================

The NF90_INQUIRE subroutine returns information about an open netCDF
dataset, given its netCDF ID. The subroutine can be called from either
define mode or data mode, and returns values for any or all of the
following: the number of dimensions, the number of variables, the
number of global attributes, and the dimension ID of the dimension
defined with unlimited length, if any.    An additional function,
NF90_INQ_FORMAT, returns the (rarely needed) format version.

   No I/O is performed when NF90_INQUIRE is called, since the required
information is available in memory for each open netCDF dataset.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_inquire(ncid, nDimensions, nVariables, nAttributes, &
                            unlimitedDimId, formatNum)
        integer,           intent( in) :: ncid
        integer, optional, intent(out) :: nDimensions, nVariables, &
                                          nAttributes, unlimitedDimId, &
                                          formatNum
        integer                        :: nf90_inquire

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`nDimensions'
     Returned number of dimensions defined for this netCDF dataset.

`nVariables'
     Returned number of variables defined for this netCDF dataset.

`nAttributes'
     Returned number of global attributes defined for this netCDF
     dataset.

`unlimitedDimID'
     Returned ID of the unlimited dimension, if there is one for this
     netCDF dataset. If no unlimited length dimension has been defined,
     -1 is returned.

`format'
     Returned integer indicating format version for this dataset, one of
     nf90_format_classic, nf90_format_64bit, nf90_format_netcdf4, or
     nf90_format_netcdf4_classic.  These are rarely needed by users or
     applications, since thhe library recognizes the format of a file
     it is accessing and handles it accordingly.

Errors
======

Function NF90_INQUIRE returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors
occurred. Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible
causes of errors include:

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_INQUIRE to find out about a netCDF dataset
named foo.nc:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status, nDims, nVars, nGlobalAtts, unlimDimID
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_nowrite, ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inquire(ncid, nDims, nVars, nGlobalAtts, unlimdimid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)

2.11 NF90_SYNC
==============

The function NF90_SYNC offers a way to synchronize the disk copy of a
netCDF dataset with in-memory buffers. There are two reasons you might
want to synchronize after writes:
   * To minimize data loss in case of abnormal termination, or

   * To make data available to other processes for reading immediately
     after it is written. But note that a process that already had the
     dataset open for reading would not see the number of records
     increase when the writing process calls NF90_SYNC; to accomplish
     this, the reading process must call NF90_SYNC.

   This function is backward-compatible with previous versions of the
netCDF library. The intent was to allow sharing of a netCDF dataset
among multiple readers and one writer, by having the writer call
NF90_SYNC after writing and the readers call NF90_SYNC before each
read. For a writer, this flushes buffers to disk. For a reader, it
makes sure that the next read will be from disk rather than from
previously cached buffers, so that the reader will see changes made by
the writing process (e.g., the number of records written) without
having to close and reopen the dataset. If you are only accessing a
small amount of data, it can be expensive in computer resources to
always synchronize to disk after every write, since you are giving up
the benefits of buffering.

   An easier way to accomplish sharing (and what is now recommended) is
to have the writer and readers open the dataset with the NF90_SHARE
flag, and then it will not be necessary to call NF90_SYNC at all.
However, the NF90_SYNC function still provides finer granularity than
the NF90_SHARE flag, if only a few netCDF accesses need to be
synchronized among processes.

   It is important to note that changes to the ancillary data, such as
attribute values, are not propagated automatically by use of the
NF90_SHARE flag. Use of the NF90_SYNC function is still required for
this purpose.

   Sharing datasets when the writer enters define mode to change the
data schema requires extra care. In previous releases, after the writer
left define mode, the readers were left looking at an old copy of the
dataset, since the changes were made to a new copy. The only way
readers could see the changes was by closing and reopening the dataset.
Now the changes are made in place, but readers have no knowledge that
their internal tables are now inconsistent with the new dataset schema.
If netCDF datasets are shared across redefinition, some mechanism
external to the netCDF library must be provided that prevents access by
readers during redefinition and causes the readers to call NF90_SYNC
before any subsequent access.

   When calling NF90_SYNC, the netCDF dataset must be in data mode. A
netCDF dataset in define mode is synchronized to disk only when
NF90_ENDDEF is called. A process that is reading a netCDF dataset that
another process is writing may call NF90_SYNC to get updated with the
changes made to the data by the writing process (e.g., the number of
records written), without having to close and reopen the dataset.

   Data is automatically synchronized to disk when a netCDF dataset is
closed, or whenever you leave define mode.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_sync(ncid)
        integer, intent( in) :: ncid
        integer              :: nf90_sync

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

Errors
======

NF90_SYNC returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The netCDF dataset is in define mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_SYNC to synchronize the disk writes of a
netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_write, ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! write data or change attributes
      ...
      status = NF90_SYNC(ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)

2.12 NF90_ABORT
===============

You no longer need to call this function, since it is called
automatically by NF90_CLOSE in case the dataset is in define mode and
something goes wrong with committing the changes. The function
NF90_ABORT just closes the netCDF dataset, if not in define mode. If the
dataset is being created and is still in define mode, the dataset is
deleted. If define mode was entered by a call to NF90_REDEF, the netCDF
dataset is restored to its state before definition mode was entered and
the dataset is closed.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_abort(ncid)
        integer, intent( in) :: ncid
        integer              :: nf90_abort

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

Errors
======

NF90_ABORT returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * When called from define mode while creating a netCDF dataset,
     deletion of the dataset failed.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_ABORT to back out of redefinitions of a
dataset named foo.nc:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status, LatDimID
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_write, ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_redef(ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_def_dim(ncid, "Lat", 18, LatDimID)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) then ! Dimension definition failed
        call handle_err(status)
        status = nf90_abort(ncid) ! Abort redefinitions
        if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      end if
     ...


File: netcdf-f90.info,  Node: NF90_SET_FILL,  Prev: NF90_ABORT,  Up: Datasets

2.13 NF90_SET_FILL
==================

This function is intended for advanced usage, to optimize writes under
some circumstances described below. The function NF90_SET_FILL sets the
fill mode for a netCDF dataset open for writing and returns the current
fill mode in a return parameter. The fill mode can be specified as
either NF90_FILL or NF90_NOFILL. The default behavior corresponding to
NF90_FILL is that data is pre-filled with fill values, that is fill
values are written when you create non-record variables or when you
write a value beyond data that has not yet been written. This makes it
possible to detect attempts to read data before it was written. *Note
Fill Values::, for more information on the use of fill values. *Note
Attribute Conventions: (netcdf)Attribute Conventions, for information
about how to define your own fill values.

   The behavior corresponding to NF90_NOFILL overrides the default
behavior of prefilling data with fill values. This can be used to
enhance performance, because it avoids the duplicate writes that occur
when the netCDF library writes fill values that are later overwritten
with data.

   A value indicating which mode the netCDF dataset was already in is
returned. You can use this value to temporarily change the fill mode of
an open netCDF dataset and then restore it to the previous mode.

   After you turn on NF90_NOFILL mode for an open netCDF dataset, you
must be certain to write valid data in all the positions that will
later be read. Note that nofill mode is only a transient property of a
netCDF dataset open for writing: if you close and reopen the dataset,
it will revert to the default behavior. You can also revert to the
default behavior by calling NF90_SET_FILL again to explicitly set the
fill mode to NF90_FILL.

   There are three situations where it is advantageous to set nofill
mode:
  1. Creating and initializing a netCDF dataset. In this case, you
     should set nofill mode before calling NF90_ENDDEF and then write
     completely all non-record variables and the initial records of all
     the record variables you want to initialize.

  2. Extending an existing record-oriented netCDF dataset. Set nofill
     mode after opening the dataset for writing, then append the
     additional records to the dataset completely, leaving no
     intervening unwritten records.

  3. Adding new variables that you are going to initialize to an
     existing netCDF dataset. Set nofill mode before calling
     NF90_ENDDEF then write all the new variables completely.

   If the netCDF dataset has an unlimited dimension and the last record
was written while in nofill mode, then the dataset may be shorter than
if nofill mode was not set, but this will be completely transparent if
you access the data only through the netCDF interfaces.

   The use of this feature may not be available (or even needed) in
future releases. Programmers are cautioned against heavy reliance upon
this feature.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_set_fill(ncid, fillmode, old_mode)
        integer, intent( in) :: ncid, fillmode
        integer, intent(out) :: old_mode
        integer              :: nf90_set_fill

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`fillmode'
     Desired fill mode for the dataset, either NF90_NOFILL or NF90_FILL.

`old_mode'
     Returned current fill mode of the dataset before this call, either
     NF90_NOFILL or NF90_FILL.

Errors
======

NF90_SET_FILL returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID refers to a dataset open for read-only
     access.

   * The fill mode argument is neither NF90_NOFILL nor NF90_FILL..

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_SET_FILL to set nofill mode for subsequent
writes of a netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status, oldMode
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_write, ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! Write data with prefilling behavior
      ...
      status = nf90_set_fill(ncid, nf90_nofill, oldMode)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      !  Write data with no prefilling
      ...

3 Groups
********

NetCDF-4 added support for hierarchical groups within netCDF datasets.

   Groups are identified with a ncid, which identifies both the open
file, and the group within that file. When a file is opened with
NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE, the ncid for the root group of that file is
provided. Using that as a starting point, users can add new groups, or
list and navigate existing groups.

   All netCDF calls take a ncid which determines where the call will
take its action. For example, the NF90_DEF_VAR function takes a ncid as
its first parameter. It will create a variable in whichever group its
ncid refers to. Use the root ncid provided by NF90_CREATE or NF90_OPEN
to create a variable in the root group. Or use NF90_DEF_GRP to create a
group and use its ncid to define a variable in the new group.

   Variable are only visible in the group in which they are defined. The
same applies to attributes. "Global" attributes are defined in
whichever group is refered to by the ncid.

   Dimensions are visible in their groups, and all child groups.

   Group operations are only permitted on netCDF-4 files - that is,
files created with the HDF5 flag in nf90_create. (*note NF90_CREATE::).
Groups are not compatible with the netCDF classic data model, so files
created with the NF90_CLASSIC_MODEL file cannot contain groups (except
the root group).

4.1 Dimensions Introduction
===========================

Dimensions for a netCDF dataset are defined when it is created, while
the netCDF dataset is in define mode. Additional dimensions may be
added later by reentering define mode. A netCDF dimension has a name
and a length. At most one dimension in a netCDF dataset can have the
unlimited length, which means variables using this dimension can grow
along this dimension.

   There is a suggested limit (512) to the number of dimensions that can
be defined in a single netCDF dataset. The limit is the value of the
constant NF90_MAX_DIMS. The purpose of the limit is to make writing
generic applications simpler. They need only provide an array of
NF90_MAX_DIMS dimensions to handle any netCDF dataset. The
implementation of the netCDF library does not enforce this advisory
maximum, so it is possible to use more dimensions, if necessary, but
netCDF utilities that assume the advisory maximums may not be able to
handle the resulting netCDF datasets.

   Ordinarily, the name and length of a dimension are fixed when the
dimension is first defined. The name may be changed later, but the
length of a dimension (other than the unlimited dimension) cannot be
changed without copying all the data to a new netCDF dataset with a
redefined dimension length.

   A netCDF dimension in an open netCDF dataset is referred to by a
small integer called a dimension ID. In the Fortran 90 interface,
dimension IDs are 1, 2, 3, ..., in the order in which the dimensions
were defined.

   Operations supported on dimensions are:
   * Create a dimension, given its name and length.

   * Get a dimension ID from its name.

   * Get a dimension's name and length from its ID.

   * Rename a dimension.

4.2 NF90_DEF_DIM
================

The function NF90_DEF_DIM adds a new dimension to an open netCDF dataset
in define mode. It returns (as an argument) a dimension ID, given the
netCDF ID, the dimension name, and the dimension length. At most one
unlimited length dimension, called the record dimension, may be defined
for each netCDF dataset.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_def_dim(ncid, name, len, dimid)
        integer,             intent( in) :: ncid
        character (len = *), intent( in) :: name
        integer,             intent( in) :: len
        integer,             intent(out) :: dimid
        integer                          :: nf90_def_dim

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`name'
     Dimension name.

`len'
     Length of dimension; that is, number of values for this dimension
     as an index to variables that use it. This should be either a
     positive integer or the predefined constant NF90_UNLIMITED.

`dimid'
     Returned dimension ID.

Errors
======

NF90_DEF_DIM returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The netCDF dataset is not in definition mode.

   * The specified dimension name is the name of another existing
     dimension.

   * The specified length is not greater than zero.

   * The specified length is unlimited, but there is already an
     unlimited length dimension defined for this netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.


Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_DEF_DIM to create a dimension named lat of
length 18 and a unlimited dimension named rec in a new netCDF dataset
named foo.nc:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status, LatDimID, RecordDimID
      ...
      status = nf90_create("foo.nc", nf90_noclobber, ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_def_dim(ncid, "Lat", 18, LatDimID)

5.1 User Defined Types Introduction
===================================

NetCDF-4 has added support for four different user defined data types.

`compound type'
     Like a C struct, a compound type is a collection of types,
     including other user defined types, in one package.

`variable length array type'
     The variable length array may be used to store ragged arrays.

`opaque type'
     This type has only a size per element, and no other type
     information.

`enum type'
     Like an enumeration in C, this type lets you assign text values to
     integer values, and store the integer values.


   Users may construct user defined type with the various NF90_DEF_*
functions described in this section. They may learn about user defined
types by using the NF90_INQ_ functions defined in this section.

   Once types are constructed, define variables of the new type with
NF90_DEF_VAR (*note NF90_DEF_VAR::). Write to them with NF90_PUT_VAR
(*note NF90_PUT_VAR::). Read data of user-defined type with
NF90_GET_VAR (*note NF90_GET_VAR::).

   Create attributes of the new type with NF90_PUT_ATT (*note
NF90_PUT_ATT::). Read attributes of the new type with NF90_GET_ATT
(*note NF90_GET_ATT::).

5.6 Compound Types Introduction
===============================

NetCDF-4 added support for compound types, which allow users to
construct a new type - a combination of other types, like a C struct.

   Compound types are not supported in classic or 64-bit offset format
files.

   To write data in a compound type, first use nf90_def_compound to
create the type, multiple calls to nf90_insert_compound to add to the
compound type, and then write data with the appropriate nf90_put_var1,
nf90_put_vara, nf90_put_vars, or nf90_put_varm call.

   To read data written in a compound type, you must know its
structure. Use the NF90_INQ_COMPOUND functions to learn about the
compound type.

   In Fortran a character buffer must be used for the compound data. The
user must read the data from within that buffer in the same way that
the C compiler which compiled netCDF would store the structure.

   The use of compound types introduces challenges and portability
issues for Fortran users.

5.6.1 Creating a Compound Type: NF90_DEF_COMPOUND
-------------------------------------------------

Create a compound type. Provide an ncid, a name, and a total size (in
bytes) of one element of the completed compound type.

   After calling this function, fill out the type with repeated calls to
NF90_INSERT_COMPOUND (*note NF90_INSERT_COMPOUND::). Call
NF90_INSERT_COMPOUND once for each field you wish to insert into the
compound type.

   Note that there does not seem to be a fully portable way to read such
types into structures in Fortran 90 (and there are no structures in
Fortran 77). Dozens of top-notch programmers are swarming over this
problem in a sub-basement of Unidata's giant underground bunker in
Wyoming.

   Fortran users may use character buffers to read and write compound
types. User are invited to try classic Fortran features such as the
equivilence and the common block statment.

5.7 Variable Length Array Introduction
======================================

NetCDF-4 added support for a variable length array type. This is not
supported in classic or 64-bit offset files, or in netCDF-4 files which
were created with the NF90_CLASSIC_MODEL flag.

   A variable length array is represented in C as a structure from HDF5,
the nf90_vlen_t structure. It contains a len member, which contains the
length of that array, and a pointer to the array.

   So an array of VLEN in C is an array of nc_vlen_t structures. The
only way to handle this in Fortran is with a character buffer sized
correctly for the platform.

   VLEN arrays are handled differently with respect to allocation of
memory. Generally, when reading data, it is up to the user to malloc
(and subsequently free) the memory needed to hold the data. It is up to
the user to ensure that enough memory is allocated.

   With VLENs, this is impossible. The user cannot know the size of an
array of VLEN until after reading the array. Therefore when reading
VLEN arrays, the netCDF library will allocate the memory for the data
within each VLEN.

   It is up to the user, however, to eventually free this memory. This

   Compression is permitted but may not be effective for VLEN data,
because the compression is applied to the nc_vlen_t structures, rather

5.7.3 Releasing Memory for a Variable Length Array (VLEN) Type: NF90_FREE_VLEN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a VLEN is read into user memory from the file, the HDF5 library
performs memory allocations for each of the variable length arrays
contained within the VLEN structure. This memory must be freed by the
user to avoid memory leaks.

   This violates the normal netCDF expectation that the user is
responsible for all memory allocation. But, with VLEN arrays, the
underlying HDF5 library allocates the memory for the user, and the user
is responsible for deallocating that memory.

Usage
=====

       function nf90_free_vlen(vl)
         character (len = *), intent(in) :: vlen
         integer :: nf90_free_vlen

5.8 Opaque Type Introduction
============================

NetCDF-4 added support for the opaque type. This is not supported in
classic or 64-bit offset files.

   The opaque type is a type which is a collection of objects of a known
size. (And each object is the same size). Nothing is known to netCDF
about the contents of these blobs of data, except their size in bytes,
and the name of the type.

   To use an opaque type, first define it with *note NF90_DEF_OPAQUE::.
If encountering an enum type in a new data file, use *note
NF90_INQ_OPAQUE:: to learn its name and size.

6.1 Variables Introduction
==========================

Variables for a netCDF dataset are defined when the dataset is created,
while the netCDF dataset is in define mode. Other variables may be
added later by reentering define mode. A netCDF variable has a name, a
type, and a shape, which are specified when it is defined. A variable
may also have values, which are established later in data mode.

   Ordinarily, the name, type, and shape are fixed when the variable is
first defined. The name may be changed, but the type and shape of a
variable cannot be changed. However, a variable defined in terms of the
unlimited dimension can grow without bound in that dimension.

   A netCDF variable in an open netCDF dataset is referred to by a small
integer called a variable ID.

   Variable IDs reflect the order in which variables were defined within
a netCDF dataset. Variable IDs are 1, 2, 3,..., in the order in which
the variables were defined. A function is available for getting the
variable ID from the variable name and vice-versa.

   Attributes (see *note Attributes::) may be associated with a
variable to specify such properties as units.

   Operations supported on variables are:
   * Create a variable, given its name, data type, and shape.

   * Get a variable ID from its name.

   * Get a variable's name, data type, shape, and number of attributes
     from its ID.

   * Put a data value into a variable, given variable ID, indices, and
     value.

   * Put an array of values into a variable, given variable ID, corner
     indices, edge lengths, and a block of values.

   * Put a subsampled or mapped array-section of values into a variable,
     given variable ID, corner indices, edge lengths, stride vector,
     index mapping vector, and a block of values.

   * Get a data value from a variable, given variable ID and indices.

   * Get an array of values from a variable, given variable ID, corner
     indices, and edge lengths.

   * Get a subsampled or mapped array-section of values from a variable,
     given variable ID, corner indices, edge lengths, stride vector, and
     index mapping vector.

   * Rename a variable.

6.2 Language Types Corresponding to netCDF external data types
==============================================================

The following table gives the netCDF external data types and the
corresponding type constants for defining variables in the FORTRAN
interface:

Type               FORTRAN API Mnemonic                        Bits
byte               NF90_BYTE                                   8
char               NF90_CHAR                                   8
short              NF90_SHORT                                  16
int                NF90_INT                                    32
float              NF90_FLOAT                                  32
double             NF90_DOUBLE                                 64

   The first column gives the netCDF external data type, which is the
same as the CDL data type. The next column gives the corresponding
Fortran 90 parameter for use in netCDF functions (the parameters are
defined in the netCDF Fortran 90 module netcdf.f90). The last column
gives the number of bits used in the external representation of values
of the corresponding type.

   Note that there are no netCDF types corresponding to 64-bit integers
or to characters wider than 8 bits in the current version of the netCDF
library.

6.3 Create a Variable: `NF90_DEF_VAR'
=====================================

The function NF90_DEF_VAR adds a new variable to an open netCDF dataset
in define mode. It returns (as an argument) a variable ID, given the
netCDF ID, the variable name, the variable type, the number of
dimensions, and a list of the dimension IDs.

   Optional arguments allow additional settings for variables in
netCDF-4/HDF5 files. These parameters allow data compression and
control of the layout of the data on disk for performance tuning.
These parameters may also be used to set the chunk sizes to get chunked
storage, or to set the contiguous flag to get contiguous storage.

   Variables that make use of one or more unlimited dimensions,
compression, or checksums must use chunking.  Such variables are
created with default chunk sizes of 1 for each unlimited dimension and
the dimension length for other dimensions, except that if the resulting
chunks are too large, the default chunk sizes for non-record dimensions
are reduced.

   All parameters after the varid are optional, and only supported if
netCDF was built with netCDF-4 features enabled, and if the variable is
in a netCDF-4/HDF5 file.

        integer                                      :: nf90_def_var

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`name'
     Variable name.

`xtype'
     One of the set of predefined netCDF external data types. The type
     of this parameter, NF90_TYPE, is defined in the netCDF header
     file. The valid netCDF external data types are NF90_BYTE,
     NF90_CHAR, NF90_SHORT, NF90_INT, NF90_FLOAT, and NF90_DOUBLE. If
     the file is a NetCDF-4/HDF5 file, the additional types NF90_UBYTE,
     NF90_USHORT, NF90_UINT, NF90_INT64, NF90_UINT64, and NF90_STRING
     may be used, as well as a user defined type ID.

`dimids'
     Vector of dimension IDs corresponding to the variable dimensions.
     For example, a vector of 2 dimension IDs specifies a 2-dimensional
     matrix.

     If an integer is passed for this parameter, a 1-D variable is
     created.

     If this parameter is not passed (or is a 1D array of size zero) it
     means the variable is a scalar with no dimensions.

     For classic data model files, if the ID of the unlimited dimension
     is included, it must be first.  In expanded model netCDF4/HDF5
     files, there may be any number of unlimited dimensions, and they
     may be used in any element of the dimids array.

     This argument is optional, and if absent specifies a scalar with no
     dimensions.

`varid'
     Returned variable ID.

`storage'
     If NF90_CONTIGUOUS, then contiguous storage is used for this
     variable. Variables that use deflation, shuffle filter, or
     checksums, or that have one or more unlimited dimensions cannot
     use contiguous storage.

     If NF90_CHUNKED, then chunked storage is used for this variable.
     Chunk sizes may be specified with the chunksizes parameter.
     Default sizes will be used if chunking is required and this
     function is not called.

     By default contiguous storage is used for fix-sized variables when
     conpression, chunking, shuffle, and checksums are not used.

`chunksizes'
     An array of chunk number of elements. This array has the number of
     elements along each dimension of the data chunk. The array must
     have the one chunksize for each dimension in the variable.

     The total size of a chunk must be less than 4 GiB. That is, the
     product of all chunksizes and the size of the data (or the size of
     nc_vlen_t for VLEN types) must be less than 4 GiB. (This is a very
     large chunk size in any case.)

     If not provided, but chunked data are needed, then default
     chunksizes will be chosen. For more information see *note The
     NetCDF Users Guide: (netcdf)Chunking.

`shuffle'
     If non-zero, turn on the shuffle filter.

`deflate_level'
     If the deflate parameter is non-zero, set the deflate level to this
     value. Must be between 1 and 9.

`fletcher32'
     Set to true to turn on fletcher32 checksums for this variable.

`endianness'
     Set to NF90_ENDIAN_LITTLE for little-endian format, NF90_ENDIAN_BIG
     for big-endian format, and NF90_ENDIAN_NATIVE (the default) for the
     native endianness of the platform.

`cache_size'
     The size of the per-variable cache in MegaBytes.

`cache_nelems'
     The number slots in the per-variable chunk cache (should be a
     prime number larger than the number of chunks in the cache).

`cache_preemption'
     The preemtion value must be between 0 and 100 inclusive and
     indicates how much chunks that have been fully read are favored for
     preemption. A value of zero means fully read chunks are treated no
     differently than other chunks (the preemption is strictly LRU)
     while a value of 100 means fully read chunks are always preempted
     before other chunks.


Return Codes
============

NF90_DEF_VAR returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error.

   * NF90_EBADNAME The specified variable name is the name of another
     existing variable.

   * NF90_EBADTYPE The specified type is not a valid netCDF type.

   * NF90_EMAXDIMS The specified number of dimensions is negative or
     more than the constant NF90_MAX_VAR_DIMS, the maximum number of
     dimensions permitted for a netCDF variable. (Does not apply to
     netCDF-4/HDF5 files unless they were created with the CLASSIC_MODE
     flag.)

   * NF90_EBADDIM One or more of the dimension IDs in the list of
     dimensions is not a valid dimension ID for the netCDF dataset.

   * NF90_EMAXVARS The number of variables would exceed the constant
     NF90_MAX_VARS, the maximum number of variables permitted in a
     classic netCDF dataset. (Does not apply to netCDF-4/HDF5 files
     unless they were created with the CLASSIC_MODE flag.)

   * NF90_BADID The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open
     netCDF dataset.

   * NF90_ENOTNC4 NetCDF-4 operation attempted on a files that is not a
     netCDF-4/HDF5 file. Only variables in NetCDF-4/HDF5 files may use
     compression, chunking, and endianness control.

   * NF90_ENOTVAR Can't find this variable.

   * NF90_EINVAL Invalid input. This may be because contiguous storage
     is requested for a variable that has compression, checksums,
     chunking, or one or more unlimited dimensions.

   * NF90_ELATEDEF This variable has already been the subject of a
     NF90_ENDDEF call. Once enddef has been called, it is impossible to
     set the chunking for a variable. (In netCDF-4/HDF5 files
     NF90_ENDDEF will be called automatically for any data read or
     write.)

   * NF90_ENOTINDEFINE Not in define mode. This is returned for netCDF
     classic or 64-bit offset files, or for netCDF-4 files, when they
     were been created with NF90_STRICT_NC3 flag. (*note NF90_CREATE::).

   * NF90_ESTRICTNC3 Trying to create a var some place other than the
     root group in a netCDF file with NF90_STRICT_NC3 turned on.


Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_DEF_VAR to create a variable named rh of
type double with three dimensions, time, lat, and lon in a new netCDF
dataset named foo.nc:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: status, ncid
      integer :: LonDimId, LatDimId, TimeDimId
      integer :: RhVarId
      ...
      status = nf90_create("foo.nc", nf90_NoClobber, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_error(status)
      ...
      ! Define the dimensions
      status = nf90_def_dim(ncid, "lat", 5, LatDimId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_error(status)
      status = nf90_def_dim(ncid, "lon", 10, LonDimId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_error(status)
      status = nf90_def_dim(ncid, "time", nf90_unlimited, TimeDimId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_error(status)
      ...
      ! Define the variable
      status = nf90_def_var(ncid, "rh", nf90_double, &
                            (/ LonDimId, LatDimID, TimeDimID /), RhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_error(status)

   In the following example, from nf_test/f90tst_vars2.f90, chunking,
checksums, and endianness control are all used in a netCDF-4/HDF5 file.

       ! Create the netCDF file.
       call check(nf90_create(FILE_NAME, nf90_netcdf4, ncid, cache_nelems = CACHE_NELEMS, &
            cache_size = CACHE_SIZE))

       ! Define the dimensions.
       call check(nf90_def_dim(ncid, "x", NX, x_dimid))
       call check(nf90_def_dim(ncid, "y", NY, y_dimid))
       dimids =  (/ y_dimid, x_dimid /)

       ! Define some variables.
       chunksizes = (/ NY, NX /)
       call check(nf90_def_var(ncid, VAR1_NAME, NF90_INT, dimids, varid1, chunksizes = chunksizes, &
            shuffle = .TRUE., fletcher32 = .TRUE., endianness = nf90_endian_big, deflate_level = DEFLATE_LEVEL))
       call check(nf90_def_var(ncid, VAR2_NAME, NF90_INT, dimids, varid2, contiguous = .TRUE.))
       call check(nf90_def_var(ncid, VAR3_NAME, NF90_INT64, varid3))
       call check(nf90_def_var(ncid, VAR4_NAME, NF90_INT, x_dimid, varid4, contiguous = .TRUE.))

6.4 Define Fill Parameters for a Variable: `nf90_def_var_fill'
==============================================================

The function NF90_DEF_VAR_FILL sets the fill parameters for a variable
in a netCDF-4 file.

   This function must be called after the variable is defined, but
before NF90_ENDDEF is called.

Usage
=====

     NF90_DEF_VAR_FILL(INTEGER NCID, INTEGER VARID, INTEGER NO_FILL, FILL_VALUE);

`NCID'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`VARID'
     Variable ID.

`NO_FILL'
     Set to non-zero value to set no_fill mode on a variable. When this
     mode is on, fill values will not be written for the variable. This
     is helpful in high performance applications. For netCDF-4/HDF5
     files (whether classic model or not), this may only be changed
     after the variable is defined, but before it is committed to disk
     (i.e. before the first NF90_ENDDEF after the NF90_DEF_VAR.) For
     classic and 64-bit offset file, the no_fill mode may be turned on
     and off at any time.

`FILL_VALUE'
     A value which will be used as the fill value for the variable.
     Must be the same type as the variable. This will be written to a
     _FillValue attribute, created for this purpose. If NULL, this
     argument will be ignored.


Return Codes
============

`NF90_NOERR'
     No error.

`NF90_BADID'
     Bad ncid.

`NF90_ENOTNC4'
     Not a netCDF-4 file.

`NF90_ENOTVAR'
     Can't find this variable.

`NF90_ELATEDEF'
     This variable has already been the subject of a NF90_ENDDEF call.
     In netCDF-4 files NF90_ENDDEF will be called automatically for any
     data read or write. Once enddef has been called, it is impossible
     to set the fill for a variable.

`NF90_ENOTINDEFINE'
     Not in define mode. This is returned for netCDF classic or 64-bit
     offset files, or for netCDF-4 files, when they were been created
     with NF90_STRICT_NC3 flag. (*note NF90_CREATE::).

`NF90_EPERM'
     Attempt to create object in read-only file.

6.5 Learn About Fill Parameters for a Variable: `NF90_INQ_VAR_FILL'
===================================================================

The function NF90_INQ_VAR_FILL returns the fill settings for a variable
in a netCDF-4 file.

Usage
=====

     NF90_INQ_VAR_FILL(INTEGER NCID, INTEGER VARID, INTEGER NO_FILL, FILL_VALUE)

`NCID'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`VARID'
     Variable ID.

`NO_FILL'
     An integer which will get a 1 if no_fill mode is set for this
     variable, and a zero if it is not set

`FILL_VALUE'
     This will get the fill value for this variable. This parameter
     will be ignored if it is NULL.


Return Codes
============

`NF90_NOERR'
     No error.

`NF90_BADID'
     Bad ncid.

6.6 Get Information about a Variable from Its ID: NF90_INQUIRE_VARIABLE
=======================================================================

NF90_INQUIRE_VARIABLE returns information about a netCDF variable given
its ID. Information about a variable includes its name, type, number of
dimensions, a list of dimension IDs describing the shape of the
variable, and the number of variable attributes that have been assigned
to the variable.

   All parameters after nAtts are optional, and only supported if netCDF
was built with netCDF-4 features enabled, and if the variable is in a
netCDF-4/HDF5 file.

Usage
=====

       function nf90_inquire_variable(ncid, varid, name, xtype, ndims, dimids, nAtts, &
            contiguous, chunksizes, deflate_level, shuffle, fletcher32, endianness)

         integer, optional, intent(out) :: endianness
         integer :: nf90_inquire_variable

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`name'
     Returned variable name. The caller must allocate space for the
     returned name. The maximum possible length, in characters, of a
     variable name is given by the predefined constant NF90_MAX_NAME.

`xtype'
     Returned variable type, one of the set of predefined netCDF
     external data types. The type of this parameter, NF90_TYPE, is
     defined in the netCDF header file. The valid netCDF external data
     types are NF90_BYTE, NF90_CHAR, NF90_SHORT, NF90_INT, NF90_FLOAT,
     AND NF90_DOUBLE.

`ndims'
     Returned number of dimensions the variable was defined as using.
     For example, 2 indicates a matrix, 1 indicates a vector, and 0
     means the variable is a scalar with no dimensions.

`dimids'
     Returned vector of *ndimsp dimension IDs corresponding to the
     variable dimensions. The caller must allocate enough space for a
     vector of at least *ndimsp integers to be returned. The maximum
     possible number of dimensions for a variable is given by the
     predefined constant NF90_MAX_VAR_DIMS.

`natts'
     Returned number of variable attributes assigned to this variable.

`contiguous'
     On return, set to NF90_CONTIGUOUS if this variable uses contiguous
     storage, NF90_CHUNKED if it uses chunked storage.

`chunksizes'
     An array of chunk sizes. The array must have the one element for
     each dimension in the variable.

`shuffle'
     True if the shuffle filter is turned on for this variable.

`deflate_level'
     The deflate_level from 0 to 9. A value of zero indicates no
     deflation is in use.

`fletcher32'
     Set to true if the fletcher32 checksum filter is turned on for this
     variable.

`endianness'
     Will be set to NF90_ENDIAN_LITTLE if this variable is stored in
     little-endian format, NF90_ENDIAN_BIG if it is stored in big-endian
     format, and NF90_ENDIAN_NATIVE if the endianness is not set, and
     the variable is not created yet.


   These functions return the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

6.8 Writing Data Values: NF90_PUT_VAR
=====================================

The function NF90_PUT_VAR puts one or more data values into the
variable of an open netCDF dataset that is in data mode. Required
inputs are the netCDF ID, the variable ID, and one or more data values.
Optional inputs may indicate the starting position of the data values
in the netCDF variable (argument start), the sampling frequency with
which data values are written into the netCDF variable (argument
stride), and a mapping between the dimensions of the data array and the
netCDF variable (argument map). The values to be written are associated
with the netCDF variable by assuming that the first dimension of the
netCDF variable varies fastest in the Fortran 90 interface. Data values
are converted to the external type of the variable, if necessary.

   Take care when using the simplest forms of this interface with record
variables (variables that use the NF90_UNLIMITED dimension) when you
don't specify how many records are to be written. If you try to write
all the values of a record variable into a netCDF file that has no
record data yet (hence has 0 records), nothing will be written.
Similarly, if you try to write all the values of a record variable from
an array but there are more records in the file than you assume, more
in-memory data will be accessed than you expect, which may cause a
segmentation violation.  To avoid such problems, it is better to
specify start and count arguments for variables that use the
NF90_UNLIMITED dimension.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_put_var(ncid, varid, values, start, count, stride, map)
        integer,                         intent( in) :: ncid, varid
        any valid type, scalar or array of any rank, &
                                         intent( in) :: values
        integer, dimension(:), optional, intent( in) :: start, count, stride, map
        integer                                      :: nf90_put_var

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`values'
     The data value(s) to be written. The data may be of any type, and
     may be a scalar or an array of any rank.  You cannot put CHARACTER
     data into a numeric variable or numeric data into a text variable.
     For numeric data, if the type of data differs from the netCDF
     variable type, type conversion will occur. *Note Type Conversion:
     (netcdf)Type Conversion.

`start'
     A vector of integers specifying the index in the variable where the
     first (or only) of the data values will be written. The indices are
     relative to 1, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (1, 1, ..., 1). The elements of start correspond,
     in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the variable is a
     record variable, the last index would correspond to the starting
     record number for writing the data values.

     By default, start(:) = 1.

`count'
     A vector of integers specifying the number of indices selected
     along each dimension. To write a single value, for example,
     specify count as (1, 1, ..., 1). The elements of count correspond,
     in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the variable is
     a record variable, the last element of count corresponds to a
     count of the number of records to write.

     By default, count(:numDims) = shape(values) and count(numDims +
     1:) = 1, where numDims = size(shape(values)).

`stride'
     A vector of integers that specifies the sampling interval along
     each dimension of the netCDF variable. The elements of the stride
     vector correspond, in order, to the netCDF variable's dimensions
     (stride(1) gives the sampling interval along the most rapidly
     varying dimension of the netCDF variable). Sampling intervals are
     specified in type-independent units of elements (a value of 1
     selects consecutive elements of the netCDF variable along the
     corresponding dimension, a value of 2 selects every other element,
     etc.).

     By default, stride(:) = 1.

`imap'
     A vector of integers that specifies the mapping between the
     dimensions of a netCDF variable and the in-memory structure of the
     internal data array. The elements of the index mapping vector
     correspond, in order, to the netCDF variable's dimensions (map(1)
     gives the distance between elements of the internal array
     corresponding to the most rapidly varying dimension of the netCDF
     variable). Distances between elements are specified in units of
     elements.

     By default, edgeLengths = shape(values), and map = (/ 1,
     (product(edgeLengths(:i)), i = 1, size(edgeLengths) - 1) /), that
     is, there is no mapping.

     Use of Fortran 90 intrinsic functions (including reshape,
     transpose, and spread) may let you avoid using this argument.

Errors
======

NF90_PUT_VAR1_  type returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors
occurred. Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible
causes of errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified indices were out of range for the rank of the
     specified variable. For example, a negative index or an index that
     is larger than the corresponding dimension length will cause an
     error.

   * The specified value is out of the range of values representable by
     the external data type of the variable.

   * The specified netCDF is in define mode rather than data mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_PUT_VAR to set the (4,3,2) element of the
variable named rh to 0.5 in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc.
For simplicity in this example, we assume that we know that rh is
dimensioned with lon, lat, and time, so we want to set the value of rh
that corresponds to the fourth lon value, the third lat value, and the
second time value:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncId, rhVarId, status
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_Write, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_put_var(ncid, rhVarId, 0.5, start = (/ 4, 3, 2 /) )
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

   In this example we use NF90_PUT_VAR to add or change all the values
of the variable named rh to 0.5 in an existing netCDF dataset named
foo.nc. We assume that we know that rh is dimensioned with lon, lat,
and time. In this example we query the netCDF file to discover the
lengths of the dimensions, then use the Fortran 90 intrinsic function
reshape to create a temporary array of data values which is the same
shape as the netCDF variable.

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer                               :: ncId, rhVarId,status,          &
                                               lonDimID, latDimId, timeDimId, &
                                               numLons, numLats, numTimes,    &
                                               i
      integer, dimension(nf90_max_var_dims) :: dimIDs
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_Write, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ! How big is the netCDF variable, that is, what are the lengths of
      !   its constituent dimensions?
      status = nf90_inquire_variable(ncid, rhVarId, dimids = dimIDs)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_inquire_dimension(ncid, dimIDs(1), len = numLons)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_inquire_dimension(ncid, dimIDs(2), len = numLats)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_inquire_dimension(ncid, dimIDs(3), len = numTimes)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! Make a temporary array the same shape as the netCDF variable.
      status = nf90_put_var(ncid, rhVarId, &
                            reshape( &
                              (/ (0.5, i = 1, numLons * numLats * numTimes) /) , &
                             shape = (/ numLons, numLats, numTimes /) )
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

   Here is an example using NF90_PUT_VAR to add or change a section of
the variable named rh to 0.5 in an existing netCDF dataset named
foo.nc. For simplicity in this example, we assume that we know that rh
is dimensioned with lon, lat, and time, that there are ten lon values,
five lat values, and three time values, and that we want to replace all
the values at the last time.

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer            :: ncId, rhVarId, status
      integer, parameter :: numLons = 10, numLats = 5, numTimes = 3
      real, dimension(numLons, numLats) &
                         :: rhValues
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_Write, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ! Fill in all values at the last time
      rhValues(:, :) = 0.5
      status = nf90_put_var(ncid, rhVarId,rhvalues,       &
                            start = (/ 1, 1, numTimes /), &
                            count = (/ numLats, numLons, 1 /))
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

   Here is an example of using NF90_PUT_VAR to write every other point
of a netCDF variable named rh having dimensions (6, 4).

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer            :: ncId, rhVarId, status
      integer, parameter :: numLons = 6, numLats = 4
      real, dimension(numLons, numLats) &
                         :: rhValues = 0.5
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_Write, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! Fill in every other value using an array section
      status = nf90_put_var(ncid, rhVarId, rhValues(::2, ::2), &
                            stride = (/ 2, 2 /))
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

   The following map vector shows the default mapping between a 2x3x4
netCDF variable and an internal array of the same shape:

      real,    dimension(2, 3, 4):: a  ! same shape as netCDF variable
      integer, dimension(3)      :: map  = (/ 1, 2, 6 /)
                          ! netCDF dimension inter-element distance
                          ! ---------------- ----------------------
                          ! most rapidly varying       1
                          ! intermediate               2 (= map(1)*2)
                          ! most slowly varying        6 (= map(2)*3)

   Using the map vector above obtains the same result as simply not
passing a map vector at all.

   Here is an example of using nf90_put_var to write a netCDF variable
named rh whose dimensions are the transpose of the Fortran 90 array:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer                           :: ncId, rhVarId, status
      integer, parameter                :: numLons = 6, numLats = 4
      real, dimension(numLons, numLats) :: rhValues
      ! netCDF variable has dimensions (numLats, numLons)
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_Write, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      !Write transposed values: map vector would be (/ 1, numLats /) for
      !   no transposition
      status = nf90_put_var(ncid, rhVarId,rhValues, map = (/ numLons, 1 /))
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

   The same effect can be obtained more simply using Fortran 90
intrinsic functions:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer                           :: ncId, rhVarId, status
      integer, parameter                :: numLons = 6, numLats = 4
      real, dimension(numLons, numLats) :: rhValues
      ! netCDF variable has dimensions (numLats, numLons)
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_Write, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_put_var(ncid, rhVarId, transpose(rhValues))
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

6.9 Reading Data Values: NF90_GET_VAR
=====================================

The function NF90_GET_VAR gets one or more data values from a netCDF
variable of an open netCDF dataset that is in data mode. Required
inputs are the netCDF ID, the variable ID, and a specification for the
data values into which the data will be read. Optional inputs may
indicate the starting position of the data values in the netCDF
variable (argument start), the sampling frequency with which data
values are read from the netCDF variable (argument stride), and a
mapping between the dimensions of the data array and the netCDF
variable (argument map). The values to be read are associated with the
netCDF variable by assuming that the first dimension of the netCDF
variable varies fastest in the Fortran 90 interface. Data values are
converted from the external type of the variable, if necessary.

   Take care when using the simplest forms of this interface with record
variables (variables that use the NF90_UNLIMITED dimension) when you
don't specify how many records are to be read. If you try to read all
the values of a record variable into an array but there are more
records in the file than you assume, more data will be read than you
expect, which may cause a segmentation violation.  To avoid such
problems, it is better to specify the optional start and count
arguments for variables that use the NF90_UNLIMITED dimension.

   In netCDF classic model the maximum integer size is NF90_INT, the
4-byte signed integer. Reading variables into an eight-byte integer
array from a classic model file will read from an NF90_INT. Reading
variables into an eight-byte integer in a netCDF-4/HDF5 (without
classic model flag) will read from an NF90_INT64

Usage
=====

      function nf90_get_var(ncid, varid, values, start, count, stride, map)
        integer,                         intent( in) :: ncid, varid
        any valid type, scalar or array of any rank, &
                                         intent(out) :: values
        integer, dimension(:), optional, intent( in) :: start, count, stride, map
        integer                                      :: nf90_get_var

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`values'
     The data value(s) to be read. The data may be of any type, and may
     be a scalar or an array of any rank.  You cannot read CHARACTER
     data from a numeric variable or numeric data from a text variable.
     For numeric data, if the type of data differs from the netCDF
     variable type, type conversion will occur. *Note Type Conversion:
     (netcdf)Type Conversion.

`start'
     A vector of integers specifying the index in the variable from
     which the first (or only) of the data values will be read. The
     indices are relative to 1, so for example, the first data value of
     a variable would have index (1, 1, ..., 1). The elements of start
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the last index would correspond to
     the starting record number for writing the data values.

     By default, start(:) = 1.

`count'
     A vector of integers specifying the number of indices selected
     along each dimension. To read a single value, for example, specify
     count as (1, 1, ..., 1). The elements of count correspond, in
     order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the variable is a
     record variable, the last element of count corresponds to a count
     of the number of records to read.

     By default, count(:numDims) = shape(values) and count(numDims +
     1:) = 1, where numDims = size(shape(values)).

`stride'
     A vector of integers that specifies the sampling interval along
     each dimension of the netCDF variable. The elements of the stride
     vector correspond, in order, to the netCDF variable's dimensions
     (stride(1) gives the sampling interval along the most rapidly
     varying dimension of the netCDF variable). Sampling intervals are
     specified in type-independent units of elements (a value of 1
     selects consecutive elements of the netCDF variable along the
     corresponding dimension, a value of 2 selects every other element,
     etc.).

     By default, stride(:) = 1.

`map'
     A vector of integers that specifies the mapping between the
     dimensions of a netCDF variable and the in-memory structure of the
     internal data array. The elements of the index mapping vector
     correspond, in order, to the netCDF variable's dimensions (map(1)
     gives the distance between elements of the internal array
     corresponding to the most rapidly varying dimension of the netCDF
     variable). Distances between elements are specified in units of
     elements.

     By default, edgeLengths = shape(values), and map = (/ 1,
     (product(edgeLengths(:i)), i = 1, size(edgeLengths) - 1) /), that
     is, there is no mapping.

     Use of Fortran 90 intrinsic functions (including reshape,
     transpose, and spread) may let you avoid using this argument.


Errors
======

NF90_GET_VAR returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The assumed or specified start, count, and stride generate an index
     which is out of range. Note that no error checking is possible on
     the map vector.

   * One or more of the specified values are out of the range of values
     representable by the desired type.

   * The specified netCDF is in define mode rather than data mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   (As noted above, another possible source of error is using this
interface to read all the values of a record variable without
specifying the number of records. If there are more records in the file
than you assume, more data will be read than you expect!)

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_GET_VAR to read the (4,3,2) element of
the variable named rh from an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc. For
simplicity in this example, we assume that we know that rh is
dimensioned with lon, lat, and time, so we want to read the value of rh
that corresponds to the fourth lon value, the third lat value, and the
second time value:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncId, rhVarId, status
      real    :: rhValue
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_NoWrite, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      -
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_get_var(ncid, rhVarId, rhValue, start = (/ 4, 3, 2 /) )
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

   In this example we use NF90_GET_VAR to read all the values of the
variable named rh from an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc. We
assume that we know that rh is dimensioned with lon, lat, and time. In
this example we query the netCDF file to discover the lengths of the
dimensions, then allocate a Fortran 90 array the same shape as the
netCDF variable.

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer                               :: ncId, rhVarId, &
                                               lonDimID, latDimId, timeDimId, &
                                               numLons, numLats, numTimes,    &
                                               status
      integer, dimension(nf90_max_var_dims) :: dimIDs
      real, dimension(:, :, :), allocatable :: rhValues
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_NoWrite, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ! How big is the netCDF variable, that is, what are the lengths of
      !   its constituent dimensions?
      status = nf90_inquire_variable(ncid, rhVarId, dimids = dimIDs)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_inquire_dimension(ncid, dimIDs(1), len = numLons)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_inquire_dimension(ncid, dimIDs(2), len = numLats)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_inquire_dimension(ncid, dimIDs(3), len = numTimes)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      allocate(rhValues(numLons, numLats, numTimes))
      ...
      status = nf90_get_var(ncid, rhVarId, rhValues)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

   Here is an example using NF90_GET_VAR to read a section of the
variable named rh from an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc. For
simplicity in this example, we assume that we know that rh is
dimensioned with lon, lat, and time, that there are ten lon values,
five lat values, and three time values, and that we want to replace all
the values at the last time.

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer            :: ncId, rhVarId, status
      integer, parameter :: numLons = 10, numLats = 5, numTimes = 3
      real, dimension(numLons, numLats, numTimes) &
                         :: rhValues
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_NoWrite, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      !Read the values at the last time by passing an array section
      status = nf90_get_var(ncid, rhVarId, rhValues(:, :, 3), &
                            start = (/ 1, 1, numTimes /),     &
                            count = (/ numLons, numLats, 1 /))
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

   Here is an example of using NF90_GET_VAR to read every other point
of a netCDF variable named rh having dimensions (6, 4).

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer            :: ncId, rhVarId, status
      integer, parameter :: numLons = 6, numLats = 4
      real, dimension(numLons, numLats) &
                         :: rhValues
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_NoWrite, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! Read every other value into an array section
      status = nf90_get_var(ncid, rhVarId, rhValues(::2, ::2) &
                            stride = (/ 2, 2 /))
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

   The following map vector shows the default mapping between a 2x3x4
netCDF variable and an internal array of the same shape:

      real,    dimension(2, 3, 4):: a  ! same shape as netCDF variable
      integer, dimension(3)      :: map  = (/ 1, 2, 6 /)
                          ! netCDF dimension inter-element distance
                          ! ---------------- ----------------------
                          ! most rapidly varying       1
                          ! intermediate               2 (= map(1)*2)
                          ! most slowly varying        6 (= map(2)*3)

   Using the map vector above obtains the same result as simply not
passing a map vector at all.

   Here is an example of using nf90_get_var to read a netCDF variable
named rh whose dimensions are the transpose of the Fortran 90 array:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer                           :: ncId, rhVarId, status
      integer, parameter                :: numLons = 6, numLats = 4
      real, dimension(numLons, numLats) :: rhValues
      ! netCDF variable has dimensions (numLats, numLons)
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_NoWrite, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! Read transposed values: map vector would be (/ 1, numLats /) for
      !   no transposition
      status = nf90_get_var(ncid, rhVarId,rhValues, map = (/ numLons, 1 /))
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

   The same effect can be obtained more simply, though using more
memory, using Fortran 90 intrinsic functions:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer                           :: ncId, rhVarId, status
      integer, parameter                :: numLons = 6, numLats = 4
      real, dimension(numLons, numLats) :: rhValues
      ! netCDF variable has dimensions (numLats, numLons)
      real, dimension(numLons, numLats) :: tempValues
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_NoWrite, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_get_var(ncid, rhVarId, tempValues))
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      rhValues(:, :) = transpose(tempValues)

6.10 Reading and Writing Character String Values
================================================

Character strings are not a primitive netCDF external data type under
the classic netCDF data model, in part because FORTRAN does not support
the abstraction of variable-length character strings (the FORTRAN LEN
function returns the static length of a character string, not its
dynamic length). As a result, a character string cannot be written or
read as a single object in the netCDF interface. Instead, a character
string must be treated as an array of characters, and array access must
be used to read and write character strings as variable data in netCDF
datasets. Furthermore, variable-length strings are not supported by the
netCDF classic interface except by convention; for example, you may
treat a zero byte as terminating a character string, but you must
explicitly specify the length of strings to be read from and written to
netCDF variables.

   Character strings as attribute values are easier to use, since the
strings are treated as a single unit for access. However, the value of
a character-string attribute in the classic netCDF interface is still
an array of characters with an explicit length that must be specified
when the attribute is defined.

   When you define a variable that will have character-string values,
use a character-position dimension as the most quickly varying dimension
for the variable (the first dimension for the variable in Fortran 90).
The length of the character-position dimension will be the maximum
string length of any value to be stored in the character-string
variable. Space for maximum-length strings will be allocated in the
disk representation of character-string variables whether you use the
space or not. If two or more variables have the same maximum length,
the same character-position dimension may be used in defining the
variable shapes.

   To write a character-string value into a character-string variable,
use either entire variable access or array access. The latter requires
that you specify both a corner and a vector of edge lengths. The
character-position dimension at the corner should be one for Fortran
90. If the length of the string to be written is n, then the vector of
edge lengths will specify n in the character-position dimension, and
one for all the other dimensions: (n, 1, 1, ..., 1).

   In Fortran 90, fixed-length strings may be written to a netCDF
dataset without a terminating character, to save space. Variable-length
strings should follow the C convention of writing strings with a
terminating zero byte so that the intended length of the string can be
determined when it is later read by either C or Fortran 90 programs.
It is the users responsibility to provide such null termination.

   If you are writing data in the default prefill mode (see next
section), you can ensure that simple strings represented as
1-dimensional character arrays are null terminated in the netCDF file
by writing fewer characters than the length declared when the variable
was defined.  That way, the extra unwritten characters will be filled
with the default character fill value, which is a null byte.  The
Fortran intrinsic TRIM function can be used to trim trailing blanks
from the character string argument to NF90_PUT_VAR to make the argument
shorter than the declared length.  If prefill is not on, the data
writer must explicitly provide a null terminating byte.

   Here is an example illustrating this way of writing strings to
character array variables:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer status
      integer                           :: ncid, oceanStrLenID, oceanId
      integer, parameter                :: MaxOceanNameLen = 20
      character, (len = MaxOceanNameLen):: ocean
      ...
      status = nf90_create("foo.nc", nf90_NoClobber, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_def_dim(ncid, "oceanStrLen", MaxOceanNameLen, oceanStrLenId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_def_var(ncid, "ocean", nf90_char, (/ oceanStrLenId /), oceanId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! Leave define mode, which prefills netCDF variables with fill values
      status = nf90_enddef(ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! Note that this assignment adds blank fill
      ocean = "Pacific"
      ! Using trim removes trailing blanks, prefill provides null
      ! termination, so C programs can later get intended string.
      status = nf90_put_var(ncid, oceanId, trim(ocean))
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

6.11 Fill Values
================

What happens when you try to read a value that was never written in an
open netCDF dataset? You might expect that this should always be an
error, and that you should get an error message or an error status
returned. You do get an error if you try to read data from a netCDF
dataset that is not open for reading, if the variable ID is invalid for
the specified netCDF dataset, or if the specified indices are not
properly within the range defined by the dimension lengths of the
specified variable. Otherwise, reading a value that was not written
returns a special fill value used to fill in any undefined values when
a netCDF variable is first written.

   You may ignore fill values and use the entire range of a netCDF
external data type, but in this case you should make sure you write all
data values before reading them. If you know you will be writing all
the data before reading it, you can specify that no prefilling of
variables with fill values will occur by calling writing. This may
provide a significant performance gain for netCDF writes.

   The variable attribute _FillValue may be used to specify the fill
value for a variable. There are default fill values for each type,
defined in module netcdf: NF90_FILL_CHAR, NF90_FILL_INT1 (same as
NF90_FILL_BYTE), NF90_FILL_INT2 (same as NF90_FILL_SHORT),
NF90_FILL_INT, NF90_FILL_REAL (same as NF90_FILL_FLOAT), and
NF90_FILL_DOUBLE

   The netCDF byte and character types have different default fill
values. The default fill value for characters is the zero byte, a
useful value for detecting the end of variable-length C character
strings. If you need a fill value for a byte variable, it is
recommended that you explicitly define an appropriate _FillValue
attribute, as generic utilities such as ncdump will not assume a
default fill value for byte variables.

   Type conversion for fill values is identical to type conversion for
other values: attempting to convert a value from one type to another
type that can't represent the value results in a range error. Such
errors may occur on writing or reading values from a larger type (such
as double) to a smaller type (such as float), if the fill value for the
larger type cannot be represented in the smaller type.

6.12 NF90_RENAME_VAR
====================

The function NF90_RENAME_VAR changes the name of a netCDF variable in an
open netCDF dataset. If the new name is longer than the old name, the
netCDF dataset must be in define mode. You cannot rename a variable to
have the name of any existing variable.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_rename_var(ncid, varid, newname)
        integer,             intent( in) :: ncid, varid
        character (len = *), intent( in) :: newname
        integer                          :: nf90_rename_var

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`newname'
     New name for the specified variable.

Errors
======

NF90_RENAME_VAR returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The new name is in use as the name of another variable.

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_RENAME_VAR to rename the variable rh to
rel_hum in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncId, rhVarId, status
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_Write, ncid)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", rhVarId)
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_redef(ncid)  ! Enter define mode to change variable name
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_rename_var(ncid, rhVarId, "rel_hum")
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_enddef(ncid) ! Leave define mode
      if(status /= nf90_NoErr) call handle_err(status)

6.13 Change between Collective and Independent Parallel Access: NF90_VAR_PAR_ACCESS
===================================================================================

The function NF90_VAR_PAR_ACCESS changes whether read/write operations
on a parallel file system are performed collectively or independently
(the default) on the variable. This function can only be called if the
file was created (see *note NF90_CREATE::) or opened (see *note
NF90_OPEN::) for parallel I/O.

   This function is only available if the netCDF library was built with
parallel I/O enabled.

   Calling this function affects only the open file - information about
whether a variable is to be accessed collectively or independently is
not written to the data file. Every time you open a file on a parallel
file system, all variables default to independent operations. The
change of a variable to collective access lasts only as long as that
file is open.

   The variable can be changed from collective to independent, and back,
as often as desired.

   Classic and 64-bit offset files, when opened for parallel access, use
the parallel-netcdf (a.k.a. pnetcdf) library, which does not allow
per-variable changes of access mode - the entire file must be access
independently or collectively. For classic and 64-bit offset files, the
nf90_var_par_access function changes the access for all variables in
the file.

Usage
=====

       function nf90_var_par_access(ncid, varid, access)
         integer, intent(in) :: ncid
         integer, intent(in) :: varid
         integer, intent(in) :: access
         integer :: nf90_var_par_access
       end function nf90_var_par_access

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN (see *note
     NF90_OPEN::) or NF90_CREATE (see *note NF90_CREATE::).

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`access'
     NF90_INDEPENDENT to set this variable to independent operations.
     NF90_COLLECTIVE to set it to collective operations.


Return Values
=============

`NF90_NOERR'
     No error.

`NF90_ENOTVAR'
     No variable found.

`NF90_NOPAR'
     File not opened for parallel access.


Example
=======

This example comes from test program nf_test/f90tst_parallel.f90. For
this test to be run, netCDF must have been built with a
parallel-enabled HDF5, and -enable-parallel-tests must have been used
when configuring netcdf.

       ! Reopen the file.
       call handle_err(nf90_open(FILE_NAME, nf90_nowrite, ncid, comm = MPI_COMM_WORLD, &
            info = MPI_INFO_NULL))

       ! Set collective access on this variable. This will cause all
       ! reads/writes to happen together on every processor.
       call handle_err(nf90_var_par_access(ncid, varid, nf90_collective))

       ! Read this processor's data.
       call handle_err(nf90_get_var(ncid, varid, data_in, start = start, count = count))

7.1 Attributes Introduction
===========================

Attributes may be associated with each netCDF variable to specify such
properties as units, special values, maximum and minimum valid values,
scaling factors, and offsets. Attributes for a netCDF dataset are
defined when the dataset is first created, while the netCDF dataset is
in define mode. Additional attributes may be added later by reentering
define mode. A netCDF attribute has a netCDF variable to which it is
assigned, a name, a type, a length, and a sequence of one or more
values. An attribute is designated by its variable ID and name. When an
attribute name is not known, it may be designated by its variable ID
and number in order to determine its name, using the function
NF90_INQ_ATTNAME.

   The attributes associated with a variable are typically defined
immediately after the variable is created, while still in define mode.
The data type, length, and value of an attribute may be changed even
when in data mode, as long as the changed attribute requires no more
space than the attribute as originally defined.

   It is also possible to have attributes that are not associated with
any variable. These are called global attributes and are identified by
using NF90_GLOBAL as a variable pseudo-ID. Global attributes are
usually related to the netCDF dataset as a whole and may be used for
purposes such as providing a title or processing history for a netCDF
dataset.

   Attributes are much more useful when they follow established
community conventions. *Note Attribute Conventions: (netcdf)Attribute
Conventions.

   Operations supported on attributes are:

   * Create an attribute, given its variable ID, name, data type,
     length, and value.

   * Get attribute's data type and length from its variable ID and name.

   * Get attribute's value from its variable ID and name.

   * Copy attribute from one netCDF variable to another.

   * Get name of attribute from its number.

   * Rename an attribute.

   * Delete an attribute.

7.2 Create an Attribute: NF90_PUT_ATT
=====================================

The function NF90_PUT_ATTadds or changes a variable attribute or global
attribute of an open netCDF dataset. If this attribute is new, or if
the space required to store the attribute is greater than before, the
netCDF dataset must be in define mode.

Usage
=====

Although it's possible to create attributes of all types, text and
double attributes are adequate for most purposes.

      function nf90_put_att(ncid, varid, name, values)
        integer,            intent( in) :: ncid, varid
        character(len = *), intent( in) :: name
        any valid type, scalar or array of rank 1, &
                            intent( in) :: values
        integer                         :: nf90_put_att

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`varid'
     Variable ID of the variable to which the attribute will be
     assigned or NF90_GLOBAL for a global attribute.

`name'
     Attribute name.  Attribute name conventions are assumed by some
     netCDF generic applications, e.g., `units' as the name for a string
     attribute that gives the units for a netCDF variable. *Note
     Attribute Conventions: (netcdf)Attribute Conventions.

`values'
     An array of attribute values. Values may be supplied as scalars or
     as arrays of rank one (one dimensional vectors). The external data
     type of the attribute is set to match the internal representation
     of the argument, that is if values is a two byte integer array,
     the attribute will be of type NF90_INT2. Fortran 90 intrinsic
     functions can be used to convert attributes to the desired type.


Errors
======

NF90_PUT_ATT returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF type is invalid.

   * The specified length is negative.

   * The specified open netCDF dataset is in data mode and the specified
     attribute would expand.

   * The specified open netCDF dataset is in data mode and the specified
     attribute does not already exist.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * The number of attributes for this variable exceeds NF90_MAX_ATTRS.


Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_PUT_ATT to add a variable attribute named
valid_range for a netCDF variable named rh and a global attribute named
title to an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status, RHVarID
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_write, ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! Enter define mode so we can add the attribute
      status = nf90_redef(ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ! Get the variable ID for "rh"...
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", RHVarID)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ! ...  put the range attribute, setting it to eight byte reals...
      status = nf90_put_att(ncid, RHVarID, "valid_range", real((/ 0, 100 /))
      ! ... and the title attribute.
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_put_att(ncid, RHVarID, "title", "example netCDF dataset") )
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ! Leave define mode
      status = nf90_enddef(ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)

7.3 Get Information about an Attribute: NF90_INQUIRE_ATTRIBUTE and NF90_INQ_ATTNAME
===================================================================================

The function NF90_INQUIRE_ATTRIBUTE returns information about a netCDF
attribute given the variable ID and attribute name. Information about
an attribute includes its type, length, name, and number. See
NF90_GET_ATT for getting attribute values.

   The function NF90_INQ_ATTNAME gets the name of an attribute, given
its variable ID and number. This function is useful in generic
applications that need to get the names of all the attributes
associated with a variable, since attributes are accessed by name
rather than number in all other attribute functions. The number of an
attribute is more volatile than the name, since it can change when
other attributes of the same variable are deleted. This is why an
attribute number is not called an attribute ID.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_inquire_attribute(ncid, varid, name, xtype, len, attnum)
        integer,             intent( in)           :: ncid, varid
        character (len = *), intent( in)           :: name
        integer,             intent(out), optional :: xtype, len, attnum
        integer                                    :: nf90_inquire_attribute
      function nf90_inq_attname(ncid, varid, attnum, name)
        integer,             intent( in) :: ncid, varid, attnum
        character (len = *), intent(out) :: name
        integer                          :: nf90_inq_attname

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`varid'
     Variable ID of the attribute's variable, or NF90_GLOBAL for a
     global attribute.

`name'
     Attribute name. For NF90_INQ_ATTNAME, this is a pointer to the
     location for the returned attribute name.

`xtype'
     Returned attribute type, one of the set of predefined netCDF
     external data types. The valid netCDF external data types are
     NF90_BYTE, NF90_CHAR, NF90_SHORT, NF90_INT, NF90_FLOAT, and
     NF90_DOUBLE.

`len'
     Returned number of values currently stored in the attribute. For a
     string-valued attribute, this is the number of characters in the
     string.

`attnum'
     For NF90_INQ_ATTNAME, the input attribute number; for
     NF90_INQ_ATTID, the returned attribute number. The attributes for
     each variable are numbered from 1 (the first attribute) to NATTS,
     where NATTS is the number of attributes for the variable, as
     returned from a call to NF90_INQ_VARNATTS.

     (If you already know an attribute name, knowing its number is not
     very useful, because accessing information about an attribute
     requires its name.)

Errors
======

Each function returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified attribute does not exist.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * For NF90_INQ_ATTNAME, the specified attribute number is negative
     or more than the number of attributes defined for the specified
     variable.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_INQUIRE_ATTRIBUTE to inquire about the
lengths of an attribute named valid_range for a netCDF variable named
rh and a global attribute named title in an existing netCDF dataset
named foo.nc:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid, status
      integer :: RHVarID                       ! Variable ID
      integer :: validRangeLength, titleLength ! Attribute lengths
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_nowrite, ncid)

7.4 Get Attribute's Values: NF90_GET_ATT
========================================

Function nf90_get_att gets the value(s) of a netCDF attribute, given
its variable ID and name.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_get_att(ncid, varid, name, values)
        integer,            intent( in) :: ncid, varid
        character(len = *), intent( in) :: name
        any valid type, scalar or array of rank 1, &
                            intent(out) :: values
        integer                         :: nf90_get_att

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`varid'
     Variable ID of the attribute's variable, or NF90_GLOBAL for a
     global attribute.

`name'
     Attribute name.

`values'
     Returned attribute values. All elements of the vector of attribute
     values are returned, so you must provide enough space to hold
     them. If you don't know how much space to reserve, call
     NF90_INQUIRE_ATTRIBUTE first to find out the length of the
     attribute. If there is only a single attribute values may be a
     scalar. If the attribute is of type character values should be a
     variable of type character with the len Fortran 90 attribute set
     to an appropriate value (i.e. character (len = 80) :: values). You
     cannot read character data from a numeric variable or numeric data
     from a text variable. For numeric data, if the type of data
     differs from the netCDF variable type, type conversion will occur.
     *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type Conversion.


Errors
======

NF90_GET_ATT_ type returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified attribute does not exist.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * One or more of the attribute values are out of the range of values
     representable by the desired type.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_GET_ATT to determine the values of an
attribute named valid_range for a netCDF variable named rh and a global
attribute named title in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc. In
this example, it is assumed that we don't know how many values will be
returned, so we first inquire about the length of the attributes to
make sure we have enough space to store them:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer              :: ncid, status
      integer              :: RHVarID                       ! Variable ID
      integer              :: validRangeLength, titleLength ! Attribute lengths
      real, dimension(:), allocatable, &
                           :: validRange
      character (len = 80) :: title
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_nowrite, ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! Find the lengths of the attributes
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", RHVarID)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_inquire_attribute(ncid, RHVarID, "valid_range", &
                                len = validRangeLength)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_inquire_attribute(ncid, nf90_global, "title", len = titleLength)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      !Allocate space to hold attribute values, check string lengths
      allocate(validRange(validRangeLength), stat = status)
      if(status /= 0 .or. len(title) < titleLength)
        print *, "Not enough space to put attribute values."
        exit
      end if
      ! Read the attributes.
      status = nf90_get_att(ncid, RHVarID, "valid_range", validRange)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_get_att(ncid, nf90_global, "title", title)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)

7.5 Copy Attribute from One NetCDF to Another: NF90_COPY_ATT
============================================================

The function NF90_COPY_ATT copies an attribute from one open netCDF
dataset to another. It can also be used to copy an attribute from one
variable to another within the same netCDF dataset.

   If used to copy an attribute of user-defined type, then that
user-defined type must already be defined in the target file. In the
case of user-defined attributes, enddef/redef is called for ncid_in and
ncid_out if they are in define mode. (This is the ensure that all
user-defined types are committed to the file(s) before the copy is
attempted.)

Usage
=====

      function nf90_copy_att(ncid_in, varid_in, name, ncid_out, varid_out)
        integer,             intent( in) :: ncid_in,  varid_in
        character (len = *), intent( in) :: name
        integer,             intent( in) :: ncid_out, varid_out
        integer                          :: nf90_copy_att

`ncid_in'
     The netCDF ID of an input netCDF dataset from which the attribute
     will be copied, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`varid_in'
     ID of the variable in the input netCDF dataset from which the
     attribute will be copied, or NF90_GLOBAL for a global attribute.

`name'
     Name of the attribute in the input netCDF dataset to be copied.

`ncid_out'
     The netCDF ID of the output netCDF dataset to which the attribute
     will be copied, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.
     It is permissible for the input and output netCDF IDs to be the
     same. The output netCDF dataset should be in define mode if the
     attribute to be copied does not already exist for the target
     variable, or if it would cause an existing target attribute to
     grow.

`varid_out'
     ID of the variable in the output netCDF dataset to which the
     attribute will be copied, or NF90_GLOBAL to copy to a global
     attribute.

Errors
======

NF90_COPY_ATT returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The input or output variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF
     dataset.

   * The specified attribute does not exist.

   * The output netCDF is not in define mode and the attribute is new
     for the output dataset is larger than the existing attribute.

   * The input or output netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF
     dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_COPY_ATT to copy the variable attribute
units from the variable rh in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc
to the variable avgrh in another existing netCDF dataset named bar.nc,
assuming that the variable avgrh already exists, but does not yet have
a units attribute:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid1, ncid2, status
      integer :: RHVarID, avgRHVarID    ! Variable ID
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_nowrite, ncid1)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_open("bar.nc", nf90_write, ncid2)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! Find the IDs of the variables
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid1, "rh", RHVarID)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid1, "avgrh", avgRHVarID)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_redef(ncid2)   ! Enter define mode
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ! Copy variable attribute from "rh" in file 1 to "avgrh" in file 1
      status = nf90_copy_att(ncid1, RHVarID, "units", ncid2, avgRHVarID)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      status = nf90_enddef(ncid2)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)

7.6 Rename an Attribute: NF90_RENAME_ATT
========================================

The function NF90_RENAME_ATT changes the name of an attribute. If the
new name is longer than the original name, the netCDF dataset must be
in define mode. You cannot rename an attribute to have the same name as
another attribute of the same variable.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_rename_att(ncid, varid, curname, newname)
        integer,             intent( in) :: ncid,  varid
        character (len = *), intent( in) :: curname, newname
        integer                          :: nf90_rename_att

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE

`varid'
     ID of the attribute's variable, or NF90_GLOBAL for a global
     attribute

`curname'
     The current attribute name.

`newname'
     The new name to be assigned to the specified attribute. If the new
     name is longer than the current name, the netCDF dataset must be in
     define mode.

Errors
======

NF90_RENAME_ATT returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:
   * The specified variable ID is not valid.

   * The new attribute name is already in use for another attribute of
     the specified variable.

   * The specified netCDF dataset is in data mode and the new name is
     longer than the old name.

   * The specified attribute does not exist.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_RENAME_ATT to rename the variable
attribute units to Units for a variable rh in an existing netCDF
dataset named foo.nc:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid1, status
      integer :: RHVarID         ! Variable ID
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_nowrite, ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      ! Find the IDs of the variables
      status = nf90_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", RHVarID)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)
      ...
      status = nf90_rename_att(ncid, RHVarID, "units", "Units")
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)

7.7 NF90_DEL_ATT
================

The function NF90_DEL_ATT deletes a netCDF attribute from an open netCDF
dataset. The netCDF dataset must be in define mode.

Usage
=====

      function nf90_del_att(ncid, varid, name)
        integer,             intent( in) :: ncid, varid
        character (len = *), intent( in) :: name
        integer                          :: nf90_del_att

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to NF90_OPEN or NF90_CREATE.

`varid'
     ID of the attribute's variable, or NF90_GLOBAL for a global
     attribute.

`name'
     The name of the attribute to be deleted.

Errors
======

NF90_DEL_ATT returns the value NF90_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The specified variable ID is not valid.

   * The specified netCDF dataset is in data mode.

   * The specified attribute does not exist.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using NF90_DEL_ATT to delete the variable attribute
Units for a variable rh in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

      use netcdf
      implicit none
      integer :: ncid1, status
      integer :: RHVarID         ! Variable ID
      ...
      status = nf90_open("foo.nc", nf90_nowrite, ncid)
      if (status /= nf90_noerr) call handle_err(status)

Appendix B Appendix B - FORTRAN 77 to Fortran 90 Transition Guide
*****************************************************************

The new Fortran 90 interface
----------------------------

The Fortran 90 interface to the netCDF library closely follows the
FORTRAN 77 interface. In most cases, function and constant names and
argument lists are the same, except that nf90_ replaces nf_ in names.
The Fortran 90 interface is much smaller than the FORTRAN 77 interface,
however. This has been accomplished by using optional arguments and
overloaded functions wherever possible.

   Because FORTRAN 77 is a subset of Fortran 90, there is no reason to
modify working FORTRAN code to use the Fortran 90 interface. New code,
however, can easily be patterned after existing FORTRAN while taking
advantage of the simpler interface. Some compilers may provide
additional support when using Fortran 90. For example, compilers may
issue warnings if arguments with intent( in) are not set before they
are passed to a procedure.

   The Fortran 90 interface is currently implemented as a set of
wrappers around the base FORTRAN subroutines in the netCDF
distribution. Future versions may be implemented entirely in Fortran
90, adding additional error checking possibilities.

Changes to Inquiry functions
----------------------------

In the Fortran 90 interface there are two inquiry functions each for
dimensions, variables, and attributes, and a single inquiry function
for datasets. These functions take optional arguments, allowing users
to request only the information they need. These functions replace the
many-argument and single-argument inquiry functions in the FORTRAN
interface.

   As an example, compare the attribute inquiry functions in the Fortran
90 interface

      function nf90_inquire_attribute(ncid, varid, name, xtype, len, attnum)
        integer,             intent( in)           :: ncid, varid
        character (len = *), intent( in)           :: name
        integer,             intent(out), optional :: xtype, len, attnum
        integer                                    :: nf90_inquire_attribute
      function nf90_inq_attname(ncid, varid, attnum, name)
        integer,             intent( in) :: ncid, varid, attnum
        character (len = *), intent(out) :: name
        integer                          :: nf90_inq_attname

   with those in the FORTRAN interface

      INTEGER FUNCTION  NF_INQ_ATT        (NCID, VARID, NAME, xtype, len)
      INTEGER FUNCTION  NF_INQ_ATTID      (NCID, VARID, NAME, attnum)
      INTEGER FUNCTION  NF_INQ_ATTTYPE    (NCID, VARID, NAME, xtype)
      INTEGER FUNCTION  NF_INQ_ATTLEN     (NCID, VARID, NAME, len)
      INTEGER FUNCTION  NF_INQ_ATTNAME    (NCID, VARID, ATTNUM, name)

Changes to put and get function
-------------------------------

The biggest simplification in the Fortran 90 is in the nf90_put_var and
nf90_get_var functions. Both functions are overloaded: the values
argument can be a scalar or an array any rank (7 is the maximum rank
allowed by Fortran 90), and may be of any numeric type or the default
character type. The netCDF library provides transparent conversion
between the external representation of the data and the desired
internal representation.

   The start, count, stride, and map arguments to nf90_put_var and
nf90_get_var are optional. By default, data is read from or written to
consecutive values of starting at the origin of the netCDF variable;
the shape of the argument determines how many values are read from or
written to each dimension. Any or all of these arguments may be
supplied to override the default behavior.

   Note also that Fortran 90 allows arbitrary array sections to be
passed to any procedure, which may greatly simplify programming. For
examples see *note NF90_PUT_VAR:: and *note NF90_GET_VAR::.
