1 Use of the NetCDF Library
***************************

You can use the netCDF library without knowing about all of the netCDF
interface. If you are creating a netCDF dataset, only a handful of
routines are required to define the necessary dimensions, variables,
and attributes, and to write the data to the netCDF dataset. (Even less
is needed if you use the ncgen utility to create the dataset before
running a program using netCDF library calls to write data.)
Similarly, if you are writing software to access data stored in a
particular netCDF object, only a small subset of the netCDF library is
required to open the netCDF dataset and access the data. Authors of
generic applications that access arbitrary netCDF datasets need to be
familiar with more of the netCDF library.

   In this chapter we provide templates of common sequences of netCDF
calls needed for common uses. For clarity we present only the names of
routines; omit declarations and error checking; omit the type-specific
suffixes of routine names for variables and attributes; indent
statements that are typically invoked multiple times; and use ... to
represent arbitrary sequences of other statements. Full parameter lists
are described in later chapters.

1.1 Creating a NetCDF Dataset
=============================

Here is a typical sequence of netCDF calls used to create a new netCDF
dataset:

         nc_create           /* create netCDF dataset: enter define mode */
              ...
            nc_def_dim       /* define dimensions: from name and length */
              ...
            nc_def_var       /* define variables: from name, type, ... */
              ...
            nc_put_att       /* put attribute: assign attribute values */
              ...
         nc_enddef           /* end definitions: leave define mode */
              ...
            nc_put_var       /* provide values for variables */
              ...
         nc_close            /* close: save new netCDF dataset */

   Only one call is needed to create a netCDF dataset, at which point
you will be in the first of two netCDF modes. When accessing an open
netCDF dataset, it is either in define mode or data mode. In define
mode, you can create dimensions, variables, and new attributes, but you
cannot read or write variable data. In data mode, you can access data
and change existing attributes, but you are not permitted to create new
dimensions, variables, or attributes.

   One call to nc_def_dim is needed for each dimension created.
Similarly, one call to nc_def_var is needed for each variable creation,
and one call to a member of the nc_put_att family is needed for each
attribute defined and assigned a value. To leave define mode and enter
data mode, call nc_enddef.

   Once in data mode, you can add new data to variables, change old
values, and change values of existing attributes (so long as the
attribute changes do not require more storage space). Single values may
be written to a netCDF variable with one of the members of the
nc_put_var1 family, depending on what type of data you have to write.
All the values of a variable may be written at once with one of the
members of the nc_put_var family. Arrays or array cross-sections of a
variable may be written using members of the nc_put_vara family.
Subsampled array sections may be written using members of the
nc_put_vars family. Mapped array sections may be written using members
of the nc_put_varm family. (Subsampled and mapped access are general
forms of data access that are explained later.)

   Finally, you should explicitly close all netCDF datasets that have
been opened for writing by calling nc_close. By default, access to the
file system is buffered by the netCDF library. If a program terminates
abnormally with netCDF datasets open for writing, your most recent
modifications may be lost. This default buffering of data is disabled
by setting the NC_SHARE flag when opening the dataset. But even if this
flag is set, changes to attribute values or changes made in define mode
are not written out until nc_sync or nc_close is called.

1.2 Reading a NetCDF Dataset with Known Names
=============================================

Here we consider the case where you know the names of not only the
netCDF datasets, but also the names of their dimensions, variables, and
attributes. (Otherwise you would have to do "inquire" calls.) The order
of typical C calls to read data from those variables in a netCDF
dataset is:

         nc_open                /* open existing netCDF dataset */
              ...
            nc_inq_dimid        /* get dimension IDs */
              ...
            nc_inq_varid        /* get variable IDs */
              ...
            nc_get_att          /* get attribute values */
              ...
            nc_get_var          /* get values of variables */
              ...
         nc_close               /* close netCDF dataset */

   First, a single call opens the netCDF dataset, given the dataset
name, and returns a netCDF ID that is used to refer to the open netCDF
dataset in all subsequent calls.

   Next, a call to nc_inq_dimid for each dimension of interest gets the
dimension ID from the dimension name. Similarly, each required variable
ID is determined from its name by a call to nc_inq_varid Once variable
IDs are known, variable attribute values can be retrieved using the
netCDF ID, the variable ID, and the desired attribute name as input to
a member of the nc_get_att family (typically nc_get_att_text or
nc_get_att_double) for each desired attribute. Variable data values can
be directly accessed from the netCDF dataset with calls to members of
the nc_get_var1 family for single values, the nc_get_var family for
entire variables, or various other members of the nc_get_vara,
nc_get_vars, or nc_get_varm families for array, subsampled or mapped
access.

   Finally, the netCDF dataset is closed with nc_close. There is no need
to close a dataset open only for reading.

1.3 Reading a netCDF Dataset with Unknown Names
===============================================

It is possible to write programs (e.g., generic software) which do such
things as processing every variable, without needing to know in advance
the names of these variables. Similarly, the names of dimensions and
attributes may be unknown.

   Names and other information about netCDF objects may be obtained from
netCDF datasets by calling inquire functions. These return information
about a whole netCDF dataset, a dimension, a variable, or an attribute.
The following template illustrates how they are used:

         nc_open                   /* open existing netCDF dataset */
           ...
         nc_inq                    /* find out what is in it */
              ...
            nc_inq_dim             /* get dimension names, lengths */
              ...
            nc_inq_var             /* get variable names, types, shapes */
                 ...
               nc_inq_attname      /* get attribute names */
                 ...
               nc_inq_att          /* get attribute types and lengths */
                 ...
               nc_get_att          /* get attribute values */
                 ...
            nc_get_var             /* get values of variables */
              ...
         nc_close                  /* close netCDF dataset */

   As in the previous example, a single call opens the existing netCDF
dataset, returning a netCDF ID. This netCDF ID is given to the nc_inq
routine, which returns the number of dimensions, the number of
variables, the number of global attributes, and the ID of the unlimited
dimension, if there is one.

   All the inquire functions are inexpensive to use and require no I/O,
since the information they provide is stored in memory when a netCDF
dataset is first opened.

   Dimension IDs use consecutive integers, beginning at 0. Also
dimensions, once created, cannot be deleted. Therefore, knowing the
number of dimension IDs in a netCDF dataset means knowing all the
dimension IDs: they are the integers 0, 1, 2, ...up to the number of
dimensions. For each dimension ID, a call to the inquire function
nc_inq_dim returns the dimension name and length.

   Variable IDs are also assigned from consecutive integers 0, 1, 2,
... up to the number of variables. These can be used in nc_inq_var
calls to find out the names, types, shapes, and the number of
attributes assigned to each variable.

   Once the number of attributes for a variable is known, successive
calls to nc_inq_attname return the name for each attribute given the
netCDF ID, variable ID, and attribute number. Armed with the attribute
name, a call to nc_inq_att returns its type and length. Given the type
and length, you can allocate enough space to hold the attribute values.
Then a call to a member of the nc_get_att family returns the attribute
values.

   Once the IDs and shapes of netCDF variables are known, data values
can be accessed by calling a member of the nc_get_var1 family for single
values, or members of the nc_get_var, nc_get_vara, nc_get_vars, or
nc_get_varm for various kinds of array access.

1.4 Adding New Dimensions, Variables, Attributes
================================================

An existing netCDF dataset can be extensively altered. New dimensions,
variables, and attributes can be added or existing ones renamed, and
existing attributes can be deleted. Existing dimensions, variables, and
attributes can be renamed. The following code template lists a typical
sequence of calls to add new netCDF components to an existing dataset:

         nc_open             /* open existing netCDF dataset */
           ...
         nc_redef            /* put it into define mode */
             ...
           nc_def_dim        /* define additional dimensions (if any) */
             ...
           nc_def_var        /* define additional variables (if any) */
             ...
           nc_put_att        /* define additional attributes (if any) */
             ...
         nc_enddef           /* check definitions, leave define mode */
             ...
           nc_put_var        /* provide values for new variables */
             ...
         nc_close            /* close netCDF dataset */

   A netCDF dataset is first opened by the nc_open call. This call puts
the open dataset in data mode, which means existing data values can be
accessed and changed, existing attributes can be changed (so long as
they do not grow), but nothing can be added. To add new netCDF
dimensions, variables, or attributes you must enter define mode, by
calling nc_redef. In define mode, call nc_def_dim to define new
dimensions, nc_def_var to define new variables, and a member of the
nc_put_att family to assign new attributes to variables or enlarge old
attributes.

   You can leave define mode and reenter data mode, checking all the new
definitions for consistency and committing the changes to disk, by
calling nc_enddef. If you do not wish to reenter data mode, just call
nc_close, which will have the effect of first calling nc_enddef.

   Until the nc_enddef call, you may back out of all the redefinitions
made in define mode and restore the previous state of the netCDF
dataset by calling nc_abort. You may also use the nc_abort call to
restore the netCDF dataset to a consistent state if the call to
nc_enddef fails. If you have called nc_close from definition mode and
the implied call to nc_enddef fails, nc_abort will automatically be
called to close the netCDF dataset and leave it in its previous
consistent state (before you entered define mode).

   For netCDF-4/HDF5 format files, define mode is still important, but
the user does not have to called nc_enddef - it is called automatically
when needed. It may also be called by the user.

   In netCDF-4/HDF5 files, there are some settings which can only be
modified during the very first define mode of the file. For example the
compression level of a variable may be set only after the nc_def_var
call and before the next nc_enddef call, whether it is called by the
user explicitly, or when the user tries to read or write some data.

   At most one process should have a netCDF dataset open for writing at
one time. The library is designed to provide limited support for
multiple concurrent readers with one writer, via disciplined use of the
nc_sync function and the NC_SHARE flag. If a writer makes changes in
define mode, such as the addition of new variables, dimensions, or
attributes, some means external to the library is necessary to prevent
readers from making concurrent accesses and to inform readers to call
nc_sync before the next access.

1.5 Error Handling
==================

The netCDF library provides the facilities needed to handle errors in a
flexible way. Each netCDF function returns an integer status value. If
the returned status value indicates an error, you may handle it in any
way desired, from printing an associated error message and exiting to
ignoring the error indication and proceeding (not recommended!). For
simplicity, the examples in this guide check the error status and call
a separate function, handle_err(), to handle any errors. One possible
definition of handle_err() can be found within the documentation of
nc_strerror (*note nc_strerror::).

   The nc_strerror function is available to convert a returned integer
error status into an error message string.

   Occasionally, low-level I/O errors may occur in a layer below the
netCDF library. For example, if a write operation causes you to exceed
disk quotas or to attempt to write to a device that is no longer
available, you may get an error from a layer below the netCDF library,
but the resulting write error will still be reflected in the returned
status value.

1.6 Compiling and Linking with the NetCDF Library
=================================================

Details of how to compile and link a program that uses the netCDF C or
FORTRAN interfaces differ, depending on the operating system, the
available compilers, where the netCDF library and include files are
installed, and whether or not you are using shared libraries.
Nevertheless, we provide here examples of how to compile and link a
program that uses the netCDF library on a Unix platform, so that you
can adjust these examples to fit your installation.

   Every C file that references netCDF functions or constants must
contain an appropriate #include statement before the first such
reference:

     #include <netcdf.h>

   Unless the netcdf.h file is installed in a standard directory where
the C compiler always looks, you must use the -I option when invoking
the compiler, to specify a directory where netcdf.h is installed, for
example:

     cc -c -I/usr/local/netcdf/include myprogram.c

   Alternatively, you could specify an absolute path name in the
#include statement, but then your program would not compile on another
platform where netCDF is installed in a different location.

   Unless the netCDF library is installed in a standard directory where
the linker always looks, you must use the -L and -l options to link an
object file that uses the netCDF library.

   If the netCDF library was configured with the -enable-shared flag,
and the operating system supports shared libraries, then it should be
possible to link an application program using a relatively simple
command. For example:

     cc -o myprogram myprogram.o -L/usr/local/netcdf/lib -lnetcdf

   It should be noted that on some operating systems, when using shared
libraries, the application itself may need to be compiled using some
form of PIC (position independent code) flag; the particular flag will
depend on the C compiler used. You should try it first without any PIC
flag, and if that fails, then check with the system administrator about
the proper form of PIC flag to use.

   In addition, for some C compilers (e.g. Sun's cc compiler) it is
necessary to specify runtime paths to the relevant libnetcdf.so.  This
can be accomplished in one of two ways.
  1. Add the path to the directory containing libnetcdf.so to the
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  This path is searched at
     runtime to locate any needed shared library.  This might be
     accomplished, for example, by the following shell command
     (assuming that libnetcdf.so is in /usr/local/netcdf/lib).
          LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/netcdf/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  2. Set the so-called runtime path when the application is linked so
     that the absolute paths of all needed shared libraries is included
     in the application binary.  For gcc under Linus, this is usually
     automatic.  For C compilers on Solaris (and probably other
     operating systems) the runtime path must be specified at link
     time. The command in this case might look like this.
          cc -o myprogram myprogram.o -L/usr/local/netcdf/lib -lnetcdf -R/usr/local/netcdf/lib
     Note that the -R flag is also C compiler dependent.  For gcc and
     Linux, for example, the specification is usually of this form.
          cc ...  -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/netcdf/lib
     Other compilers may use other flags to specify this. Check with
     the local system administrator.

   If shared libraries are not supported or are not being used for some
reason, then it is necessary to include all the dependent libraries in
the compile command.  For example, for a netCDF-4 enabled library, it
will be necessary to link with two HDF5 libraries, at least one
compression library, and (on some systems) the math library.
     cc -o myprogram myprogram.o -L/usr/local/netcdf/lib -L/usr/local/hdf5/lib -lnetcdf -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lz

   Other configuration features (e.g. DAP support or parallel IO) may
require additional libraries.

   A complete list of necessary libraries can be obtained by executing
the "nc-config -libs" command.  For example:
     ./nc-config --libs
   might return something like this:
     -L/tmp/install/spock/lib -lnetcdf -L/upc/share/stdinstall/local/spock/lib
     -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -L/upc/share/stdinstall/local/spock/lib -lz -lm
     -L/upc/share/stdinstall/local/spock/lib -lcurl -L/usr/kerberos/lib64
     -L/upc/share/stdinstall/local/spock/lib
     -lidn -lssl -lcrypto -lldap -lrt -lssl -lcrypto -ldl -lz -lz

   Obviously there is some redundancy in this list, so it can be reduced
somewhat to produce this slightly simpler list.
     -L/tmp/install/spock/lib -lnetcdf
     -L/upc/share/stdinstall/local/spock/lib -lhdf5 -lhdf5_hl -lz -lcurl
     -L/usr/kerberos/lib64 -lcrypto -lssl
     -ldl -lidn -lldap -lm -lrt

2 Datasets
**********

This chapter presents the interfaces of the netCDF functions that deal
with a netCDF dataset or the whole netCDF library.

   A netCDF dataset that has not yet been opened can only be referred to
by its dataset name. Once a netCDF dataset is opened, it is referred to
by a netCDF ID, which is a small non-negative integer returned when you
create or open the dataset. A netCDF ID is much like a file descriptor
in C or a logical unit number in FORTRAN. In any single program, the
netCDF IDs of distinct open netCDF datasets are distinct. A single
netCDF dataset may be opened multiple times and will then have multiple
distinct netCDF IDs; however at most one of the open instances of a
single netCDF dataset should permit writing. When an open netCDF
dataset is closed, the ID is no longer associated with a netCDF dataset.

   Functions that deal with the netCDF library include:
   * Get version of library.

   * Get error message corresponding to a returned error code.

   The operations supported on a netCDF dataset as a single object are:
   * Create, given dataset name and whether to overwrite or not.

   * Open for access, given dataset name and read or write intent.

   * Put into define mode, to add dimensions, variables, or attributes.

   * Take out of define mode, checking consistency of additions.

   * Close, writing to disk if required.

   * Inquire about the number of dimensions, number of variables,
     number of global attributes, and ID of the unlimited dimension, if
     any.

   * Synchronize to disk to make sure it is current.

   * Set and unset nofill mode for optimized sequential writes.

   * After a summary of conventions used in describing the netCDF
     interfaces, the rest of this chapter presents a detailed
     description of the interfaces for these operations.

2.1 NetCDF Library Interface Descriptions
=========================================

Each interface description for a particular netCDF function in this and
later chapters contains:

   * a description of the purpose of the function;

   * a C function prototype that presents the type and order of the
     formal parameters to the function;

   * a description of each formal parameter in the C interface;

   * a list of possible error conditions; and

   * an example of a C program fragment calling the netCDF function (and
     perhaps other netCDF functions).

   The examples follow a simple convention for error handling, always
checking the error status returned from each netCDF function call and
calling a handle_error function in case an error was detected. For an
example of such a function, see *note nc_strerror::.


File: netcdf-c.info,  Node: parallel access,  Next: nc_strerror,  Prev: Interface Descriptions,  Up: Datasets

2.2 Parallel Access for NetCDF Files
====================================

To use parallel access, open or create the file with nc_open_par (see
*note nc_open_par::) or nc_create_par (see *note nc_create_par::).

   The mode flag NC_PNETCDF will be automatically turned on for classic
or 64-bit offset files opened or created with the parallel access
functions.

   The following example shows the creation of a file using parallel
access with a netCDF-4/HDF5 file, and how a program might write data to
such a file.

     #include "netcdf.h"
     #include <mpi.h>
     #include <assert.h>

File: netcdf-c.info,  Node: nc_strerror,  Next: nc_inq_libvers,  Prev: parallel access,  Up: Datasets

2.3 Get error message corresponding to error status: nc_strerror
================================================================

The function nc_strerror returns a static reference to an error message
string corresponding to an integer netCDF error status or to a system
error number, presumably returned by a previous call to some other
netCDF function. The list of netCDF error status codes is available in
the appropriate include file for each language binding.

Usage
=====

     const char * nc_strerror(int ncerr);

`ncerr'
     An error status that might have been returned from a previous call
     to some netCDF function.

Errors
======

If you provide an invalid integer error status that does not correspond
to any netCDF error message or or to any system error message (as
understood by the system strerror function), nc_strerror returns a
string indicating that there is no such error status.

Example
=======

Here is an example of a simple error handling function that uses
nc_strerror to print the error message corresponding to the netCDF
error status returned from any netCDF function call and then exit:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     void handle_error(int status) {
     if (status != NC_NOERR) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", nc_strerror(status));
        exit(-1);
        }
     }


File: netcdf-c.info,  Node: nc_inq_libvers,  Next: nc_create,  Prev: nc_strerror,  Up: Datasets

2.4 Get netCDF library version: nc_inq_libvers
==============================================

The function nc_inq_libvers returns a string identifying the version of
the netCDF library, and when it was built.

Usage
=====

     const char * nc_inq_libvers(void);

Errors
======

This function takes no arguments, and thus no errors are possible in
its invocation.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_inq_libvers to print the version of the
netCDF library with which the program is linked:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
        printf("%s\n", nc_inq_libvers());


File: netcdf-c.info,  Node: nc_create,  Next: nc__create,  Prev: nc_inq_libvers,  Up: Datasets

2.5 Create a NetCDF Dataset: nc_create
======================================

This function creates a new netCDF dataset, returning a netCDF ID that
can subsequently be used to refer to the netCDF dataset in other netCDF
function calls. The new netCDF dataset opened for write access and
placed in define mode, ready for you to add dimensions, variables, and
attributes.

   A creation mode flag specifies:

   * whether to overwrite any existing dataset with the same name,

   * whether access to the dataset is shared,

   * whether this file should be in netCDF classic format (the default),
     the new 64-bit offset format (use NC_64BIT_OFFSET), or NC_NETCDF4
     for a netCDF-4/HDF5 file.

Usage
=====

NOTE: When creating a netCDF-4 file HDF5 error reporting is turned off,
if it is on. This doesn't stop the HDF5 error stack from recording the
errors, it simply stops their display to the user through stderr.

     int nc_create (const char* path, int cmode, int *ncidp);

`path'
     The file name of the new netCDF dataset.

`cmode'
     The creation mode flag. The following flags are available:
     NC_NOCLOBBER, NC_SHARE, NC_64BIT_OFFSET, NC_NETCDF4,
     NC_CLASSIC_MODEL.

     Setting NC_NOCLOBBER means you do not want to clobber (overwrite)
     an existing dataset; an error (NC_EEXIST) is returned if the
     specified dataset already exists.

     The NC_SHARE flag is appropriate when one process may be writing
     the dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
     concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
     caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
     sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially
     may see some performance improvement by setting the NC_SHARE flag.
     This flag is ignored for netCDF-4 files. (See below.)

     Setting NC_64BIT_OFFSET causes netCDF to create a 64-bit offset
     format file, instead of a netCDF classic format file. The 64-bit
     offset format imposes far fewer restrictions on very large (i.e.
     over 2 GB) data files. *Note Large File Support: (netcdf)Large
     File Support.

     A zero value (defined for convenience as NC_CLOBBER) specifies the
     default behavior: overwrite any existing dataset with the same file
     name and buffer and cache accesses for efficiency. The dataset
     will be in netCDF classic format. *Note NetCDF Classic Format
     Limitations: (netcdf)NetCDF Classic Format Limitations.

     Setting NC_NETCDF4 causes netCDF to create a HDF5/NetCDF-4 file.

     Setting NC_CLASSIC_MODEL causes netCDF to enforce the classic data
     model in this file. (This only has effect for netCDF-4/HDF5 files,
     as classic and 64-bit offset files always use the classic model.)
     When used with NC_NETCDF4, this flag ensures that the resulting
     netCDF-4/HDF5 file may never contain any new constructs from the
     enhanced data model. That is, it cannot contain groups, user
     defined types, multiple unlimited dimensions, or new atomic types.
     The advantage of this restriction is that such files are
     guaranteed to work with existing netCDF software.

`ncidp'
     Pointer to location where returned netCDF ID is to be stored.

Errors
======

nc_create returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Possible
causes of errors include:
   * Passing a dataset name that includes a directory that does not
     exist.

   * Specifying a dataset name of a file that exists and also specifying
     NC_NOCLOBBER.

   * Specifying a meaningless value for the creation mode.

   * Attempting to create a netCDF dataset in a directory where you
     don't have permission to create files.

Return Codes
============

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_ENOMEM'
     System out of memory.

`NC_EHDFERR'
     HDF5 error (netCDF-4 files only).

`NC_EFILEMETA'
     Error writing netCDF-4 file-level metadata in HDF5 file. (netCDF-4
     files only).


Examples
========

In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo.nc; we want the
dataset to be created in the current directory only if a dataset with
that name does not already exist:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

   In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo_large.nc. It
will be in the 64-bit offset format.

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo_large.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER|NC_64BIT_OFFSET, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

   In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo_HDF5.nc. It will
be in the HDF5 format.

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo_HDF5.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER|NC_NETCDF4, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

   In this example we create a netCDF dataset named
foo_HDF5_classic.nc. It will be in the HDF5 format, but will not allow
the use of any netCDF-4 advanced features. That is, it will conform to
the classic netCDF-3 data model.

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo_HDF5_classic.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER|NC_NETCDF4|NC_CLASSIC_MODEL, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

   A variant of nc_create, nc__create (note the double underscore)
allows users to specify two tuning parameters for the file that it is
creating. These tuning parameters are not written to the data file,
they are only used for so long as the file remains open after an
nc__create. *Note nc__create::.

2.6 Create a NetCDF Dataset With Performance Options: nc__create
================================================================

This function is a variant of nc_create, nc__create (note the double
underscore) allows users to specify two tuning parameters for the file
that it is creating. These tuning parameters are not written to the
data file, they are only used for so long as the file remains open
after an nc__create.

   This function creates a new netCDF dataset, returning a netCDF ID
that can subsequently be used to refer to the netCDF dataset in other
netCDF function calls. The new netCDF dataset opened for write access
and placed in define mode, ready for you to add dimensions, variables,
and attributes.

   A creation mode flag specifies whether to overwrite any existing
dataset with the same name and whether access to the dataset is shared,
and whether this file should be in netCDF classic format (the default),
or the new 64-bit offset format.

Usage
=====

     int nc__create(const char *path, int cmode, size_t initialsz,
                    size_t *bufrsizehintp, int *ncidp);

`path'
     The file name of the new netCDF dataset.

`cmode'
     The creation mode flag. The following flags are available:
     NC_NOCLOBBER, NC_SHARE, and NC_64BIT_OFFSET, NC_NETCDF4,
     NC_CLASSIC_MODEL.

     Setting NC_NOCLOBBER means you do not want to clobber (overwrite)
     an existing dataset; an error (NC_EEXIST) is returned if the
     specified dataset already exists.

     The NC_SHARE flag is appropriate when one process may be writing
     the dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
     concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
     caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
     sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially
     may see some performance improvement by setting the NC_SHARE flag.
     This flag is ignored for netCDF-4 files. (See below.)

     Setting NC_64BIT_OFFSET causes netCDF to create a 64-bit offset
     format file, instead of a netCDF classic format file. The 64-bit
     offset format imposes far fewer restrictions on very large (i.e.
     over 2 GB) data files. *Note Large File Support: (netcdf)Large
     File Support.

     A zero value (defined for convenience as NC_CLOBBER) specifies the
     default behavior: overwrite any existing dataset with the same file
     name and buffer and cache accesses for efficiency. The dataset
     will be in netCDF classic format. *Note NetCDF Classic Format
     Limitations: (netcdf)NetCDF Classic Format Limitations.

     Setting NC_NETCDF4 causes netCDF to create a HDF5/NetCDF-4 file.

     Setting NC_CLASSIC_MODEL causes netCDF to enforce the classic data
     model in this file. (This only has effect for netCDF-4/HDF5 files,
     as classic and 64-bit offset files always use the classic model.)
     When used with NC_NETCDF4, this flag ensures that the resulting

     defined types, multiple unlimited dimensions, or new atomic types.
     The advantage of this restriction is that such files are
     guaranteed to work with existing netCDF software.

`initialsz'
     On some systems, and with custom I/O layers, it may be
     advantageous to set the size of the output file at creation time.
     This parameter sets the initial size of the file at creation time.

`bufrsizehintp'
     The argument referenced by bufrsizehintp controls a space versus
     time tradeoff, memory allocated in the netcdf library versus
     number of system calls.

     Because of internal requirements, the value may not be set to
     exactly the value requested. The actual value chosen is returned
     by reference.

     Using the value NC_SIZEHINT_DEFAULT causes the library to choose a
     default. How the system chooses the default depends on the system.
     On many systems, the "preferred I/O block size" is available from
     the stat() system call, struct stat member st_blksize. If this is
     available it is used. Lacking that, twice the system pagesize is
     used.

     Lacking a call to discover the system pagesize, we just set default
     bufrsize to 8192.

     The bufrsize is a property of a given open netcdf descriptor ncid,
     it is not a persistent property of the netcdf dataset.

`ncidp'
     Pointer to location where returned netCDF ID is to be stored.

Errors
======

nc_create returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Possible
causes of errors include:
   * Passing a dataset name that includes a directory that does not
     exist.

   * Specifying a dataset name of a file that exists and also specifying
     NC_NOCLOBBER.

   * Specifying a meaningless value for the creation mode.

   * Attempting to create a netCDF dataset in a directory where you
     don't have permission to create files.

Return Codes
============

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_ENOMEM'
     System out of memory.

`NC_EHDFERR'
     HDF5 error (netCDF-4 files only).

`NC_EFILEMETA'
     Error writing netCDF-4 file-level metadata in HDF5 file. (netCDF-4
     files only).


Examples
========

In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo.nc; we want the
dataset to be created in the current directory only if a dataset with
that name does not already exist:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

   In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo_large.nc; we
want the dataset to be created in the current directory only if a
dataset with that name does not already exist. We also specify that
bufrsize and initial size for the file.

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
     int intialsz = 2048;
     int *bufrsize;
        ...
     *bufrsize = 1024;
     status = nc__create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, initialsz, bufrsize, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.7 Create a NetCDF Dataset With Performance Options: nc_create_par
===================================================================

This function is a variant of nc_create, nc_create_par allows users to
open a file on a MPI/IO or MPI/Posix parallel file system.

   The parallel parameters are not written to the data file, they are
only used for so long as the file remains open after an nc_create_par.

   This function creates a new netCDF dataset, returning a netCDF ID
that can subsequently be used to refer to the netCDF dataset in other
netCDF function calls. The new netCDF dataset opened for write access
and placed in define mode, ready for you to add dimensions, variables,
and attributes.

   If the NC_NETCDF4 flag is used, the HDF5 library is used for parallel
I/O. If not, the parallel-netcdf library is used.

   When a file is created for parallel access, independent operations
are the default. To use independent access on a variable, *Note
nc_var_par_access::.

Usage
=====

     int nc_create_par(const char *path, int cmode, MPI_Comm comm,
                       MPI_Info info, int ncidp);

`path'
     The file name of the new netCDF dataset.

`cmode'
     Either the NC_MPIIO or NC_MPIPOSIX flags may be present if the
     NC_NETCDF4 flag is used.

     The NC_SHARE flag is ignored.

`comm'
     The MPI_Comm object returned by the MPI layer.

`info'
     The MPI_Info object returned by the MPI layer, if MPI/IO is being
     used, or 0 if MPI/Posix is being used.

`ncidp'
     Pointer to location where returned netCDF ID is to be stored.


Return Codes
============

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_EPARINIT'
     Could not initialize parallel access at the HDF5 layer.

`NC_EFILEMETA'
     HDF5 layer cannot handle create or root group open.

`NC_EEXIST'
     Specifying a dataset name of a file that exists and also specifying
     NC_NOCLOBBER.

`NC_EINVAL'
     Bad value for the creation mode.

`NC_EHDFERR'
     Unexpected error from the HDF5 layer.


Examples
========

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     *bufrsize = 1024;
     status = nc__create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, initialsz, bufrsize, &ncid);

2.8 Open a NetCDF Dataset for Access: nc_open
=============================================

The function nc_open opens an existing netCDF dataset for access. It
determines the underlying file format automatically. Use the same call
to open a netCDF classic, 64-bit offset, or netCDF-4 file.

Usage
=====

     int nc_open (const char *path, int omode, int *ncidp);

`path'
     File name for netCDF dataset to be opened.  When DAP support is
     enabled, then the path may be an OPeNDAP URL rather than a file
     path.

`omode'
     A zero value (or NC_NOWRITE) specifies the default behavior: open
     the dataset with read-only access, buffering and caching accesses
     for efficiency

     Otherwise, the open mode is NC_WRITE, NC_SHARE, or
     NC_WRITE|NC_SHARE. Setting the NC_WRITE flag opens the dataset with
     read-write access. ("Writing" means any kind of change to the
     dataset, including appending or changing data, adding or renaming
     dimensions, variables, and attributes, or deleting attributes.)

     The NC_SHARE flag is only used for netCDF classic and 64-bit offset
     files. It is appropriate when one process may be writing the
     dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
     concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
     caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
     sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially
     may see some performance improvement by setting the NC_SHARE flag.

     It is not necessary to pass any information about the format of the
     file being opened. The file type will be detected automatically by
     the netCDF library.

     If a the path is a DAP URL, then the open mode is read-only.
     Setting NC_WRITE will be ignored.

`ncidp'
     Pointer to location where returned netCDF ID is to be stored.

Errors
======

When opening a netCDF-4 file HDF5 error reporting is turned off, if it
is on. This doesn't stop the HDF5 error stack from recording the
errors, it simply stops their display to the user through stderr.

   nc_open returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The specified netCDF dataset does not exist.

   * A meaningless mode was specified.

Return Codes
============

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_NOMEM'
     Out of memory.

`NC_EHDFERR'
     HDF5 error. (NetCDF-4 files only.)

`NC_EDIMMETA'
     Error in netCDF-4 dimension metadata. (NetCDF-4 files only.)

`NC_ENOCOMPOIND'
     (NetCDF-4 files only.)


Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_open to open an existing netCDF dataset
named foo.nc for read-only, non-shared access:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", 0, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.9 Open a NetCDF Dataset for Access with Performance Tuning: nc__open
======================================================================

A function opens a netCDF dataset for access with an additional
performance tuning parameter.  When DAP support is enabled, it is
possible to open a DAP data source through this interface, but it is
deprecated because all of the performance tuning parameters are ignored.
The standard nc_open interface should be used instead.

Usage
=====

     int nc__open(const char *path, int mode, size_t *bufrsizehintp, int *ncidp);

`path'
     File name for netCDF dataset to be opened.

`omode'
     A zero value (or NC_NOWRITE) specifies the default behavior: open
     the dataset with read-only access, buffering and caching accesses
     for efficiency

     Otherwise, the open mode is NC_WRITE, NC_SHARE, or
     NC_WRITE|NC_SHARE. Setting the NC_WRITE flag opens the dataset with
     read-write access. ("Writing" means any kind of change to the
     dataset, including appending or changing data, adding or renaming
     dimensions, variables, and attributes, or deleting attributes.)
     The NC_SHARE flag is appropriate when one process may be writing
     the dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
     concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
     caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
     sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially
     may see some performance improvement by setting the NC_SHARE flag.

`bufrsizehintp'
     The argument referenced by bufrsizehintp controls a space versus
     time tradeoff, memory allocated in the netcdf library versus
     number of system calls.

     Because of internal requirements, the value may not be set to
     exactly the value requested. The actual value chosen is returned
     by reference.

     Using the value NC_SIZEHINT_DEFAULT causes the library to choose a
     default. How the system chooses the default depends on the system.
     On many systems, the "preferred I/O block size" is available from
     the stat() system call, struct stat member st_blksize. If this is
     available it is used. Lacking that, twice the system pagesize is
     used.

     Lacking a call to discover the system pagesize, we just set default
     bufrsize to 8192.

     The bufrsize is a property of a given open netcdf descriptor ncid,
     it is not a persistent property of the netcdf dataset.

`ncidp'
     Pointer to location where returned netCDF ID is to be stored.

Errors
======

nc__open returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The specified netCDF dataset does not exist.

   * A meaningless mode was specified.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc__open to open an existing netCDF dataset
named foo.nc for read-only, non-shared access:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
     size_t bufrsize;
        ...
     *bufrsize = 1024;
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", 0, &bufrsize, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.10 Open a NetCDF Dataset for Parallel Access
==============================================

This function opens a netCDF-4 dataset for parallel access.

   For netcdf-4/HDF5 files, the HDF5 library parallel I/O is used. This
opens the file using either MPI-IO or MPI-POSIX.

   DAP access is not allowed with parallel I/O.

   When netCDF opens a file for parallel access, independent operations
are the default. To use independent access on a variable, *Note
nc_var_par_access::.

Usage
=====

     int nc_open_par(const char *path, int mode, MPI_Comm comm,
                     MPI_Info info, int *ncidp);

`path'
     File name for netCDF dataset to be opened.

`omode'
     Either the NC_MPIIO or NC_MPIPOSIX flags may be present for a
     netCDF-4/HDF5 file.

     The flag NC_WRITE opens the dataset with read-write access.
     ("Writing" means any kind of change to the dataset, including
     appending or changing data, adding or renaming dimensions,
     variables, and attributes, or deleting attributes.)

     All other flags are ignored or not allowed. The NC_NETCDF4 flag is
     not required, as the file type is detected when the file is opened.

`comm'
     MPI_Comm object returned by the MPI layer.

`info'
     MPI_Info object returned by the MPI layer, or NULL if MPI-POSIX
     access is desired.

`ncidp'
     Pointer to location where returned netCDF ID is to be stored.


Return Codes
============

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`'
     The specified netCDF dataset does not exist.

`'
     A meaningless mode was specified.


Example
=======

Here is an example (from nc_test4/tst_parallel2.c) using nc_open_par.

         /* Reopen the file and check it. */
         if (nc_open_par(file_name, NC_NOWRITE, comm, info, &ncid)) ERR;

         /* Read all the slabs this process is responsible for. */
         for (i = 0; i < NUM_SLABS / mpi_size; i++)
         {
            start[0] = NUM_SLABS / mpi_size * mpi_rank + i;
            /* Read one slab of data. */
            if (nc_get_vara_int(ncid, varid, start, count, data_in)) ERR;

2.11 Put Open NetCDF Dataset into Define Mode: nc_redef
=======================================================

The function nc_redef puts an open netCDF dataset into define mode, so
dimensions, variables, and attributes can be added or renamed and
attributes can be deleted.

Usage
=====

For netCDF-4 files (i.e. files created with NC_NETCDF4 in the cmode,
*note nc_create::), it is not necessary to call nc_redef unless the
file was also created with NC_STRICT_NC3. For straight-up netCDF-4
files, nc_redef is called automatically, as needed.

   For all netCDF-4 files, the root ncid must be used. This is the ncid
returned by nc_open and nc_create, and points to the root of the
hierarchy tree for netCDF-4 files.

     int nc_redef(int ncid);

`ncid'
     netCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

Errors
======

nc_redef returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The specified netCDF dataset is already in define mode. This error
     code will only be returned for classic and 64-bit offset format
     files.

   * The specified netCDF dataset was opened for read-only.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Errors
======

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_EBADID'
     Bad ncid.

`NC_EBADGRPID'
     The ncid must refer to the root group of the file, that is, the
     group returned by nc_open or nc_create. (*note nc_open:: *note
     nc_create::).

`NC_EINDEFINE'
     Already in define mode.

`NC_EPERM'
     File is read-only.


Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_redef to open an existing netCDF dataset
named foo.nc and put it into define mode:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);  /* open dataset */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_redef(ncid);                      /* put in define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.12 Leave Define Mode: nc_enddef
=================================

The function nc_enddef takes an open netCDF dataset out of define mode.
The changes made to the netCDF dataset while it was in define mode are
checked and committed to disk if no problems occurred. Non-record
variables may be initialized to a "fill value" as well. *Note
nc_set_fill::. The netCDF dataset is then placed in data mode, so
variable data can be read or written.

   It's not necessary to call nc_enddef for netCDF-4 files. With
netCDF-4 files, nc_enddef is called when needed by the netcdf-4
library. User calls to nc_enddef for netCDF-4 files still flush the
metadata to disk.

   This call may involve copying data under some circumstances. For a
more extensive discussion see *note File Structure and Performance:
(netcdf)File Structure and Performance.

   For netCDF-4/HDF5 format files there are some variable settings (the
compression, endianness, fletcher32 error correction, and fill value)
which must be set (if they are going to be set at all) between the
nc_def_var and the next nc_enddef. Once the nc_enddef is called, these
settings can no longer be changed for a variable.

Usage
=====

     int nc_enddef(int ncid);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create. If you
     use a group id, the enddef will apply to the entire file. That
     all, the enddef will not just end define mode in one group, but in
     the entire file.

Errors
======

nc_enddef returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The specified netCDF dataset is not in define mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * The size of one or more variables exceed the size constraints for
     whichever variant of the file format is in use).  *Note Large File
     Support: (netcdf)Large File Support.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_enddef to finish the definitions of a new
netCDF dataset named foo.nc and put it into data mode:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...       /* create dimensions, variables, attributes */

     status = nc_enddef(ncid);  /*leave define mode*/
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.13 Leave Define Mode with Performance Tuning: nc__enddef
==========================================================

The function nc__enddef takes an open netCDF dataset out of define
mode. The changes made to the netCDF dataset while it was in define
mode are checked and committed to disk if no problems occurred.
Non-record variables may be initialized to a "fill value" as well.
*Note nc_set_fill::. The netCDF dataset is then placed in data mode, so
variable data can be read or written.

   This call may involve copying data under some circumstances. For a
more extensive discussion see *note File Structure and Performance:
(netcdf)File Structure and Performance.

   Caution: this function exposes internals of the netcdf version 1 file
format. Users should use nc_enddef in most circumstances. This function
may not be available on future netcdf implementations.

   The current netcdf file format has three sections, the "header"
section, the data section for fixed size variables, and the data
section for variables which have an unlimited dimension (record
variables).

   The header begins at the beginning of the file. The index (offset) of
the beginning of the other two sections is contained in the header.
Typically, there is no space between the sections. This causes copying
overhead to accrue if one wishes to change the size of the sections, as
may happen when changing names of things, text attribute values, adding
attributes or adding variables. Also, for buffered i/o, there may be
advantages to aligning sections in certain ways.

   The minfree parameters allow one to control costs of future calls to
nc_redef, nc_enddef by requesting that minfree bytes be available at
the end of the section.

   The align parameters allow one to set the alignment of the beginning
of the corresponding sections. The beginning of the section is rounded
up to an index which is a multiple of the align parameter. The flag
value ALIGN_CHUNK tells the library to use the bufrsize (see above) as
the align parameter.  It has nothing to do with the chunking
(multidimensional tiling) features of netCDF-4.

   The file format requires mod 4 alignment, so the align parameters
are silently rounded up to multiples of 4. The usual call,

     nc_enddef(ncid);

   is equivalent to

     nc__enddef(ncid, 0, 4, 0, 4);

   The file format does not contain a "record size" value, this is
calculated from the sizes of the record variables. This unfortunate
fact prevents us from providing minfree and alignment control of the
"records" in a netcdf file. If you add a variable which has an
unlimited dimension, the third section will always be copied with the
new variable added.

Usage
=====

     int nc__enddef(int ncid, size_t h_minfree, size_t v_align,
                    size_t v_minfree, size_t r_align);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`h_minfree'
     Sets the pad at the end of the "header" section.

`v_align'
     Controls the alignment of the beginning of the data section for
     fixed size variables.

`v_minfree'
     Sets the pad at the end of the data section for fixed size
     variables.

`r_align'
     Controls the alignment of the beginning of the data section for
     variables which have an unlimited dimension (record variables).


Errors
======

nc__enddef returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The specified netCDF dataset is not in define mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * The size of one or more variables exceed the size constraints for
     whichever variant of the file format is in use).  *Note Large File
     Support: (netcdf)Large File Support.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_enddef to finish the definitions of a new
netCDF dataset named foo.nc and put it into data mode:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...       /* create dimensions, variables, attributes */

     status = nc_enddef(ncid);  /*leave define mode*/

2.14 Close an Open NetCDF Dataset: nc_close
===========================================

The function nc_close closes an open netCDF dataset.

   If the dataset in define mode, nc_enddef will be called before
closing. (In this case, if nc_enddef returns an error, nc_abort will
automatically be called to restore the dataset to the consistent state
before define mode was last entered.) After an open netCDF dataset is
closed, its netCDF ID may be reassigned to the next netCDF dataset that
is opened or created.

Usage
=====

For netCDF-4 files, the ncid of the root group must be passed into
nc_close.

     int nc_close(int ncid);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

Errors
======

nc_close returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * Define mode was entered and the automatic call made to nc_enddef
     failed.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_EBADID'
     Invalid id passed.

`NC_EBADGRPID'
     ncid did not contain the root group id of this file. (NetCDF-4
     only).


Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_close to finish the definitions of a new
netCDF dataset named foo.nc and release its netCDF ID:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...       /* create dimensions, variables, attributes */

     status = nc_close(ncid);       /* close netCDF dataset */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.15 Inquire about an Open NetCDF Dataset: nc_inq Family
========================================================

Members of the nc_inq family of functions return information about an
open netCDF dataset, given its netCDF ID. Dataset inquire functions may
be called from either define mode or data mode. The first function,
nc_inq, returns values for the number of dimensions, the number of
variables, the number of global attributes, and the dimension ID of the
dimension defined with unlimited length, if any. Most of the other
functions in the family each return just one of these items of
information.

   For C, these functions include nc_inq, nc_inq_ndims, nc_inq_nvars,
nc_inq_natts, and nc_inq_unlimdim.  An additional function,
nc_inq_format, returns the (rarely needed) format version.  Another
function, nc_inq_path, returns the file name or URL with which a file
was opened or created.

   No I/O is performed when these functions are called, since the
required information is available in memory for each open netCDF
dataset.

Usage
=====

     int nc_inq          (int ncid, int *ndimsp, int *nvarsp, int *ngattsp,
                          int *unlimdimidp);
     int nc_inq_ndims    (int ncid, int *ndimsp);
     int nc_inq_nvars    (int ncid, int *nvarsp);
     int nc_inq_natts    (int ncid, int *ngattsp);

Errors
======

All members of the nc_inq family return the value NC_NOERR if no errors
occurred. Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible
causes of errors include:
   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_inq to find out about a netCDF dataset
named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status, ncid, ndims, nvars, ngatts, unlimdimid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_NOWRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.16 Synchronize an Open NetCDF Dataset to Disk: nc_sync
========================================================

The function nc_sync offers a way to synchronize the disk copy of a
netCDF dataset with in-memory buffers. There are two reasons you might
want to synchronize after writes:
   * To minimize data loss in case of abnormal termination, or

   * To make data available to other processes for reading immediately
     after it is written. But note that a process that already had the
     dataset open for reading would not see the number of records
     increase when the writing process calls nc_sync; to accomplish
     this, the reading process must call nc_sync.

   This function is backward-compatible with previous versions of the
netCDF library. The intent was to allow sharing of a netCDF dataset
among multiple readers and one writer, by having the writer call
nc_sync after writing and the readers call nc_sync before each read.
For a writer, this flushes buffers to disk. For a reader, it makes sure
that the next read will be from disk rather than from previously cached
buffers, so that the reader will see changes made by the writing
process (e.g., the number of records written) without having to close
and reopen the dataset. If you are only accessing a small amount of
data, it can be expensive in computer resources to always synchronize
to disk after every write, since you are giving up the benefits of
buffering.

   An easier way to accomplish sharing (and what is now recommended) is
to have the writer and readers open the dataset with the NC_SHARE flag,
and then it will not be necessary to call nc_sync at all. However, the
nc_sync function still provides finer granularity than the NC_SHARE
flag, if only a few netCDF accesses need to be synchronized among
processes.

   It is important to note that changes to the ancillary data, such as
attribute values, are not propagated automatically by use of the
NC_SHARE flag. Use of the nc_sync function is still required for this
purpose.

   Sharing datasets when the writer enters define mode to change the
data schema requires extra care. In previous releases, after the writer
left define mode, the readers were left looking at an old copy of the
dataset, since the changes were made to a new copy. The only way
readers could see the changes was by closing and reopening the dataset.
Now the changes are made in place, but readers have no knowledge that
their internal tables are now inconsistent with the new dataset schema.
If netCDF datasets are shared across redefinition, some mechanism
external to the netCDF library must be provided that prevents access by
readers during redefinition and causes the readers to call nc_sync
before any subsequent access.

   When calling nc_sync, the netCDF dataset must be in data mode. A
netCDF dataset in define mode is synchronized to disk only when
nc_enddef is called. A process that is reading a netCDF dataset that
another process is writing may call nc_sync to get updated with the
changes made to the data by the writing process (e.g., the number of
records written), without having to close and reopen the dataset.

   Data is automatically synchronized to disk when a netCDF dataset is
closed, or whenever you leave define mode.

Usage
=====

     int nc_sync(int ncid);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

Errors
======

nc_sync returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The netCDF dataset is in define mode.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_sync to synchronize the disk writes of a
netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status;
     int ncid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);  /* open for writing */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...           /* write data or change attributes */

     status = nc_sync(ncid);      /* synchronize to disk */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

2.17 Back Out of Recent Definitions: nc_abort
=============================================

You no longer need to call this function, since it is called
automatically by nc_close in case the dataset is in define mode and
something goes wrong with committing the changes. The function nc_abort
just closes the netCDF dataset, if not in define mode. If the dataset
is being created and is still in define mode, the dataset is deleted.
If define mode was entered by a call to nc_redef, the netCDF dataset is
restored to its state before definition mode was entered and the
dataset is closed.

Usage
=====

     int nc_abort(int ncid);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

Errors
======

nc_abort returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * When called from define mode while creating a netCDF dataset,
     deletion of the dataset failed.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_abort to back out of redefinitions of a
dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int ncid, status, latid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);/* open for writing */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_redef(ncid);                    /* enter define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_def_dim(ncid, "lat", 18L, &latid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) {
        handle_error(status);
        status = nc_abort(ncid);                 /* define failed, abort */
        if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     }

2.18 Set Fill Mode for Writes: nc_set_fill
==========================================

This function is intended for advanced usage, to optimize writes under
some circumstances described below. The function nc_set_fill sets the
fill mode for a netCDF dataset open for writing and returns the current
fill mode in a return parameter. The fill mode can be specified as
either NC_FILL or NC_NOFILL. The default behavior corresponding to
NC_FILL is that data is pre-filled with fill values, that is fill
values are written when you create non-record variables or when you
write a value beyond data that has not yet been written. This makes it
possible to detect attempts to read data before it was written. For
more information on the use of fill values see *note Fill Values::. For
information about how to define your own fill values see *note
Attribute Conventions: (netcdf)Attribute Conventions.

   The behavior corresponding to NC_NOFILL overrides the default
behavior of prefilling data with fill values. This can be used to
enhance performance, because it avoids the duplicate writes that occur
when the netCDF library writes fill values that are later overwritten
with data.

   A value indicating which mode the netCDF dataset was already in is
returned. You can use this value to temporarily change the fill mode of
an open netCDF dataset and then restore it to the previous mode.

   After you turn on NC_NOFILL mode for an open netCDF dataset, you must
be certain to write valid data in all the positions that will later be
read. Note that nofill mode is only a transient property of a netCDF
dataset open for writing: if you close and reopen the dataset, it will
revert to the default behavior. You can also revert to the default
behavior by calling nc_set_fill again to explicitly set the fill mode
to NC_FILL.

   There are three situations where it is advantageous to set nofill
mode:

  1. Creating and initializing a netCDF dataset. In this case, you
     should set nofill mode before calling nc_enddef and then write
     completely all non-record variables and the initial records of all
     the record variables you want to initialize.

  2. Extending an existing record-oriented netCDF dataset. Set nofill
     mode after opening the dataset for writing, then append the
     additional records to the dataset completely, leaving no
     intervening unwritten records.

  3. Adding new variables that you are going to initialize to an
     existing netCDF dataset. Set nofill mode before calling nc_enddef
     then write all the new variables completely.


   If the netCDF dataset has an unlimited dimension and the last record
was written while in nofill mode, then the dataset may be shorter than
if nofill mode was not set, but this will be completely transparent if
you access the data only through the netCDF interfaces.

   The use of this feature may not be available (or even needed) in
future releases. Programmers are cautioned against heavy reliance upon
this feature.

Usage
=====

     int nc_set_fill (int ncid, int fillmode, int *old_modep);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`fillmode'
     Desired fill mode for the dataset, either NC_NOFILL or NC_FILL.

`old_modep'
     Pointer to location for returned current fill mode of the dataset
     before this call, either NC_NOFILL or NC_FILL.

Return Codes
============

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_EBADID'
     The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

`NC_EPERM'
     The specified netCDF ID refers to a dataset open for read-only
     access.

`NC_EINVAL'
     The fill mode argument is neither NC_NOFILL nor NC_FILL.


Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_set_fill to set nofill mode for subsequent
writes of a netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int ncid, status, old_fill_mode;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);  /* open for writing */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...           /* write data with default prefilling behavior */

     status = nc_set_fill(ncid, NC_NOFILL, &old_fill_mode); /* set nofill */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

        ...           /* write data with no prefilling */

2.19 Set Default Creation Format: nc_set_default_format
=======================================================

This function is intended for advanced users.

   Starting in version 3.6, netCDF introduced a new data format, the
first change in the underlying binary data format since the netCDF
interface was released. The new format, 64-bit offset format, was
introduced to greatly relax the limitations on creating very large
files.

   Users are warned that creating files in the 64-bit offset format
makes them unreadable by the netCDF library prior to version 3.6.0. For
reasons of compatibility, users should continue to create files in
netCDF classic format.

   Users who do want to use 64-bit offset format files can create them
directory from nc_create, using the proper cmode flag.  (*note
nc_create::).

   The function nc_set_default_format allows the user to change the
format of the netCDF file to be created by future calls to nc_create
(or nc__create) without changing the cmode flag.

   This allows the user to convert a program to use 64-bit offset
formation without changing all calls the nc_create. *Note Large File
Support: (netcdf)Large File Support.

   Once the default format is set, all future created files will be in
the desired format.

   Two constants are provided in the netcdf.h file to be used with this
function, NC_FORMAT_64BIT and NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC.

   If a non-NULL pointer is provided, it is assumed to point to an int,
where the existing default format will be written.

   Using nc_create with a cmode including NC_64BIT_OFFSET overrides the
default format, and creates a 64-bit offset file.

Usage
=====

     int nc_set_default_format(int format, int *old_formatp);

`format'
     Valid formats include NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC (the default),
     NC_FORMAT_64BIT, and, if -enable-netcdf-4 was used during
     configure, NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4 and NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4_CLASSIC

`old_formatp'
     Either NULL (in which case it will be ignored), or a pointer to an
     int where the existing default format (i.e. before being changed
     to the new format) will be written. This allows you to get the
     existing default format while setting a new default format.


Return Codes
============

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_EINVAL'
     Invalid format. Valid formats include NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC,
     NC_FORMAT_64BIT, and, if -enable-netcdf-4 was used during
     configure, NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4 and NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4_CLASSIC. Trying
     to set the default format to something else will result in an
     invalid argument error.


Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_set_default_format to create the same file
in four formats with the same nc_create call (from libsrc4/tst_utf8.c):

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
           int ncid, varid, dimids[NDIMS];
           int f;

           for (f = NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC; f < NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4_CLASSIC; f++)
           {
              if (nc_set_default_format(f, NULL)) ERR;
              if (nc_create(FILE_NAME, NC_CLOBBER, &ncid)) ERR;

2.20 Set HDF5 Chunk Cache for Future File Opens/Creates: nc_set_chunk_cache
===========================================================================

This function changes the default chunk cache settings in the HDF5
library for all variables in the file. The settings apply for
subsequent file opens/creates. This function does not change the chunk
cache settings of already open files.

   For more information, see the documentation for the H5Pset_cache()
function in the HDF5 library at the HDF5 website:
`http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/'.

Usage
=====

     int nc_set_chunk_cache(size_t size, size_t nelems, float preemption);

`size'
     The total size of the raw data chunk cache, in bytes. This should
     be big enough to hold multiple chunks of data.

`nelems'
     The number of chunk slots in the raw data chunk cache hash table.
     This should be a prime number larger than the number of chunks
     that will be in the cache.

`preemption'
     The preemtion value must be between 0 and 1 inclusive and indicates
     how much chunks that have been fully read are favored for
     preemption. A value of zero means fully read chunks are treated no
     differently than other chunks (the preemption is strictly LRU)
     while a value of one means fully read chunks are always preempted
     before other chunks.


Return Codes
============

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_EINVAL'
     Preemption must be between zero and one (inclusive).


Example

2.21 Get the HDF5 Chunk Cache Settings for Future File Opens/Creates: nc_get_chunk_cache
========================================================================================

This function gets the chunk cache settings for the HDF5 library. The
settings apply for subsequent file opens/creates.

   This affects the per-file chunk cache which the HDF5 layer
maintains. The chunk cache size can be tuned for better performance.

   For more information, see the documentation for the H5Pget_cache()
function in the HDF5 library at the HDF5 website:
`http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/'.

Usage
=====

     int nc_get_chunk_cache(size_t *sizep, size_t *nelemsp, float *preemptionp);

`sizep'
     The total size of the raw data chunk cache will be put here. If
     NULL, will be ignored.

`nelemsp'
     The number of chunk slots in the raw data chunk cache hash table
     will be put here.  If NULL, will be ignored.

`preemptionp'
     The preemption will be put here.  The preemtion value is between 0
     and 1 inclusive and indicates how much chunks that have been fully
     read are favored for preemption.  A value of zero means fully read
     chunks are treated no differently than other chunks (the
     preemption is strictly LRU) while a value of one means fully read
     chunks are always preempted before other chunks.  If NULL, will be
     ignored.

3 Groups
********

NetCDF-4 added support for hierarchical groups within netCDF datasets.

   Groups are identified with a ncid, which identifies both the open
file, and the group within that file. When a file is opened with
nc_open or nc_create, the ncid for the root group of that file is
provided. Using that as a starting point, users can add new groups, or
list and navigate existing groups.

   All netCDF calls take a ncid which determines where the call will
take its action. For example, the nc_def_var function takes a ncid as
its first parameter. It will create a variable in whichever group its
ncid refers to. Use the root ncid provided by nc_create or nc_open to
create a variable in the root group. Or use nc_def_grp to create a
group and use its ncid to define a variable in the new group.

   Variable are only visible in the group in which they are defined.
The same applies to attributes. "Global" attributes are associated with
the group whose ncid is used.

   Dimensions are visible in their groups, and all child groups.

   Group operations are only permitted on netCDF-4 files - that is,
files created with the HDF5 flag in nc_create. (*note nc_create::).
Groups are not compatible with the netCDF classic data model, so files
created with the NC_CLASSIC_MODEL file cannot contain groups (except
the root group).

4.1 Dimensions Introduction
===========================

Dimensions for a netCDF dataset are defined when it is created, while
the netCDF dataset is in define mode. Additional dimensions may be
added later by reentering define mode. A netCDF dimension has a name
and a length. In a netCDF classic or 64-bit offset file, at most one
dimension can have the unlimited length, which means variables using
this dimension can grow along this dimension. In a netCDF-4 file
multiple unlimited dimensions are supported.

   There is a suggested limit (100) to the number of dimensions that can
be defined in a single netCDF dataset. The limit is the value of the
predefined macro NC_MAX_DIMS. The purpose of the limit is to make
writing generic applications simpler. They need only provide an array
of NC_MAX_DIMS dimensions to handle any netCDF dataset. The
implementation of the netCDF library does not enforce this advisory
maximum, so it is possible to use more dimensions, if necessary, but
netCDF utilities that assume the advisory maximums may not be able to
handle the resulting netCDF datasets.

   Ordinarily, the name and length of a dimension are fixed when the
dimension is first defined. The name may be changed later, but the
length of a dimension (other than the unlimited dimension) cannot be
changed without copying all the data to a new netCDF dataset with a
redefined dimension length.

   Dimension lengths in the C interface are type size_t rather than type
int to make it possible to access all the data in a netCDF dataset on a
platform that only supports a 16-bit int data type, for example MSDOS.
If dimension lengths were type int instead, it would not be possible to
access data from variables with a dimension length greater than a
16-bit int can accommodate.

   A netCDF dimension in an open netCDF dataset is referred to by a
small integer called a dimension ID. In the C interface, dimension IDs
are 0, 1, 2, ..., in the order in which the dimensions were defined.

   Operations supported on dimensions are:
   * Create a dimension, given its name and length.

   * Get a dimension ID from its name.

   * Get a dimension's name and length from its ID.

   * Rename a dimension.

4.2 Create a Dimension: nc_def_dim
==================================

The function nc_def_dim adds a new dimension to an open netCDF dataset
in define mode. It returns (as an argument) a dimension ID, given the
netCDF ID, the dimension name, and the dimension length. At most one
unlimited length dimension, called the record dimension, may be defined
for each classic or 64-bit offset netCDF dataset. NetCDF-4 datasets may
have multiple unlimited dimensions.

Usage
=====

     int nc_def_dim (int ncid, const char *name, size_t len, int *dimidp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF group ID, from a previous call to nc_open, nc_create,
     nc_def_grp, etc.

`name'
     Dimension name.

`len'
     Length of dimension; that is, number of values for this dimension
     as an index to variables that use it. This should be either a
     positive integer (of type size_t) or the predefined constant
     NC_UNLIMITED.

`dimidp'
     Pointer to location for returned dimension ID.

Errors
======

nc_def_dim returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:
   * The netCDF dataset is not in definition mode.

   * The specified dimension name is the name of another existing
     dimension.

   * The specified length is not greater than zero.

   * The specified length is unlimited, but there is already an
     unlimited length dimension defined for this netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.


Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_def_dim to create a dimension named lat of
length 18 and a unlimited dimension named rec in a new netCDF dataset
named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status, ncid, latid, recid;
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_def_dim(ncid, "lat", 18L, &latid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_def_dim(ncid, "rec", NC_UNLIMITED, &recid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

4.3 Get a Dimension ID from Its Name: nc_inq_dimid
==================================================

The function nc_inq_dimid returns (as an argument) the ID of a netCDF
dimension, given the name of the dimension. If ndims is the number of
dimensions defined for a netCDF dataset, each dimension has an ID
between 0 and ndims-1.

Usage
=====

When searching for a dimension, the specified group is searched, and
then its parent group, and then its grandparent group, etc., up to the
root group.

     int nc_inq_dimid (int ncid, const char *name, int *dimidp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`name'
     Dimension name.

`dimidp'
     Pointer to location for the returned dimension ID.


Errors
======

nc_inq_dimid returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   The name that was specified is not the name of a dimension in the
netCDF dataset.  The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open
netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_inq_dimid to determine the dimension ID of
a dimension named lat, assumed to have been defined previously in an
existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status, ncid, latid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_NOWRITE, &ncid);  /* open for reading */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_dimid(ncid, "lat", &latid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

4.4 Inquire about a Dimension: nc_inq_dim Family
================================================

This family of functions returns information about a netCDF dimension.
Information about a dimension includes its name and its length. The
length for the unlimited dimension, if any, is the number of records
written so far.

   The functions in this family include nc_inq_dim, nc_inq_dimname, and
nc_inq_dimlen. The function nc_inq_dim returns all the information
about a dimension; the other functions each return just one item of
information.

Usage
=====

     int nc_inq_dim     (int ncid, int dimid, char* name, size_t* lengthp);
     int nc_inq_dimname (int ncid, int dimid, char *name);
     int nc_inq_dimlen  (int ncid, int dimid, size_t *lengthp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`dimid'
     Dimension ID, from a previous call to nc_inq_dimid or nc_def_dim.

`name'
     Returned dimension name. The caller must allocate space for the
     returned name. The maximum possible length, in characters, of a
     dimension name is given by the predefined constant NC_MAX_NAME.
     (This doesn't include the null terminator, so declare your array
     to be size NC_MAX_NAME+1). The returned character array will be
     null-terminated.

`lengthp'
     Pointer to location for returned length of dimension. For the
     unlimited dimension, this is the number of records written so far.


Errors
======

These functions return the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The dimension ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Here is an example using nc_inq_dim to determine the length of a
dimension named lat, and the name and current maximum length of the
unlimited dimension for an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status, ncid, latid, recid;
     size_t latlength, recs;
     char recname[NC_MAX_NAME+1];
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_NOWRITE, &ncid);  /* open for reading */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_inq_unlimdim(ncid, &recid); /* get ID of unlimited dimension */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_dimid(ncid, "lat", &latid);  /* get ID for lat dimension */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_inq_dimlen(ncid, latid, &latlength); /* get lat length */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     /* get unlimited dimension name and current length */
     status = nc_inq_dim(ncid, recid, recname, &recs);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

4.5 Rename a Dimension: nc_rename_dim
=====================================

The function nc_rename_dim renames an existing dimension in a netCDF
dataset open for writing. You cannot rename a dimension to have the
same name as another dimension.

   For netCDF classic and 64-bit offset files, if the new name is longer
than the old name, the netCDF dataset must be in define mode.

   For netCDF-4 files the dataset is switched to define more for the
rename, regardless of the name length.

Usage
=====

int nc_rename_dim(int ncid, int dimid, const char* name);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`dimid'
     Dimension ID, from a previous call to nc_inq_dimid or nc_def_dim.

`name'
     New dimension name.


Errors
======

nc_rename_dim returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   * The new name is the name of another dimension.

   * The dimension ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.

   * The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

   * The new name is longer than the old name and the netCDF dataset is
     not in define mode.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_rename_dim to rename the dimension lat to
latitude in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int status, ncid, latid;
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);  /* open for writing */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_redef(ncid);  /* put in define mode to rename dimension */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_inq_dimid(ncid, "lat", &latid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_rename_dim(ncid, latid, "latitude");
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     status = nc_enddef(ncid); /* leave define mode */
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

4.6 Find All Unlimited Dimension IDs: nc_inq_unlimdims
======================================================

In netCDF-4 files, it's possible to have multiple unlimited dimensions.
This function returns a list of the unlimited dimension ids visible in
a group.

   Dimensions are visible in a group if they have been defined in that
group, or any ancestor group.

Usage
=====

     int nc_inq_unlimdims(int ncid, int *nunlimdimsp, int *unlimdimidsp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF group ID, from a previous call to nc_open, nc_create,
     nc_def_grp, etc.

`nunlimdimsp'
     A pointer to an int which will get the number of visible unlimited
     dimensions. Ignored if NULL.

`unlimdimidsp'
     A pointer to an already allocated array of int which will get the
     ids of all visible unlimited dimensions. Ignored if NULL. To
     allocate the correct length for this array, call nc_inq_unlimdims
     with a NULL for this parameter and use the nunlimdimsp parameter
     to get the number of visible unlimited dimensions.


Errors
======

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_EBADID'
     Bad group id.

`NC_ENOTNC4'
     Attempting a netCDF-4 operation on a netCDF-3 file. NetCDF-4
     operations can only be performed on files defined with a create
     mode which includes flag HDF5. (*note nc_open::).

`NC_ESTRICTNC3'
     This file was created with the strict netcdf-3 flag, therefore
     netcdf-4 operations are not allowed. (*note nc_open::).

`NC_EHDFERR'
     An error was reported by the HDF5 layer.


Example
=======

        int root_ncid, num_unlimdims, unlimdims[NC_MAX_DIMS];
        char file[] = "nc4_test.nc";
        int res;

        /* Open the file. */
        if ((res = nc_open(file, NC_NOWRITE, &root_ncid)))
           return res;

        /* Find out if there are any unlimited dimensions in the root
           group. */
        if ((res = nc_inq_unlimdims(root_ncid, &num_unlimdims, unlimdims)))
           return res;

        printf("nc_inq_unlimdims reports %d unlimited dimensions\n", num_unlimdims);

5.1 User Defined Types Introduction
===================================

NetCDF-4 has added support for four different user defined data types.
User defined type may only be used in files created with the NC_NETCDF4
and without NC_CLASSIC_MODEL.

`compound type'
     Like a C struct, a compound type is a collection of types,
     including other user defined types, in one package.

`variable length array type'
     The variable length array may be used to store ragged arrays.

`opaque type'
     This type has only a size per element, and no other type
     information.

`enum type'
     Like an enumeration in C, this type lets you assign text values to
     integer values, and store the integer values.


   Users may construct user defined type with the various nc_def_*
functions described in this section. They may learn about user defined
types by using the nc_inq_ functions defined in this section.

   Once types are constructed, define variables of the new type with
nc_def_var (*note nc_def_var::). Write to them with nc_put_var1,
nc_put_var, nc_put_vara, or nc_put_vars (*note Variables::). Read data
of user-defined type with nc_get_var1, nc_get_var, nc_get_vara, or
nc_get_vars (*note Variables::).

   Create attributes of the new type with nc_put_att (*note nc_put_att_
type::). Read attributes of the new type with nc_get_att (*note
nc_get_att_ type::).

Usage
=====

     int nc_inq_typeids(int ncid, int *ntypes, int *typeids);

`ncid'
     The group id.

`ntypes'
     A pointer to int which will get the number of types defined in the
     group. If NULL, ignored.

`typeids'
     A pointer to an int array which will get the typeids. If NULL,
     ignored.


Errors
======

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_BADID'
     Bad ncid.


Example
=======

The following example is from the test program libsrc4/tst_enums.c.

================================================

Given an ncid and a typeid, get the information about a type. This
function will work on any type, including atomic and any user defined
type, whether compound, opaque, enumeration, or variable length array.

   For even more information about a user defined type *note
nc_inq_user_type::.

Usage
=====

     nc_inq_type(int ncid, nc_type xtype, char *name, size_t *sizep);

`ncid'

5.6 Compound Types Introduction
===============================

Compound data types can be defined for netCDF-4/HDF5 format files. A
compound datatype is similar to a struct in C and contains a collection
of one or more atomic or user-defined types. The netCDF-4 compound data
must comply with the properties and constraints of the HDF5 compound
data type in terms of which it is implemented.

   In summary these are:
   * It has a fixed total size.

   * It consists of zero or more named members that do not overlap with
     other members.

   * Each member has a name distinct from other members.

   * Each member has its own datatype.

   * Each member is referenced by an index number between zero and N-1,
     where N is the number of members in the compound datatype.

   * Each member has a fixed byte offset, which is the first byte
     (smallest byte address) of that member in the compound datatype.

   * In addition to other other user-defined data types or atomic
     datatypes, a member can be a small fixed-size array of any type
     with up to four fixed-size "dimensions" (not associated with named
     netCDF dimensions).

   Currently there is an HDF5 restriction on total size of a compound
type to not larger than 2^16 = 65536 bytes. Attempts to exceed this
limit result in an NC_EHDFERR error.

   Compound types are not supported in classic or 64-bit offset format
files.

   To write data in a compound type, first use nc_def_compound to
create the type, multiple calls to nc_insert_compound to add to the
compound type, and then write data with the appropriate nc_put_var1,
nc_put_vara, nc_put_vars, or nc_put_varm call.

   To read data written in a compound type, you must know its
structure. Use the nc_inq_compound functions to learn about the compound
type.

* nc_insert_compound::
* nc_inq_compound::

5.7 Creating a Compound Type: nc_def_compound
=============================================

Create a compound type. Provide an ncid, a name, and a total size (in
bytes) of one element of the completed compound type.

   After calling this function, fill out the type with repeated calls to
nc_insert_compound (*note nc_insert_compound::). Call
nc_insert_compound once for each field you wish to insert into the
compound type.

   Note that there does not seem to be a way to read such types into
structures in Fortran 90 (and there are no structures in Fortran 77).

Usage
=====

     int nc_def_compound(int ncid, size_t size, const char *name, nc_type *typeidp);

`ncid'
     The groupid where this compound type will be created.

`size'
     The size, in bytes, of the compound type.

`name'
     The name of the new compound type.

`typeidp'
     A pointer to an nc_type. The typeid of the new type will be placed
     there.


Errors
======

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_EBADID'
     Bad group id.

`NC_ENAMEINUSE'

`NC_ESTRICTNC3'
     This file was created with the strict netcdf-3 flag, therefore
     netcdf-4 operations are not allowed. (*note nc_open::).

`NC_EHDFERR'
     An error was reported by the HDF5 layer.

5.21 Variable Length Array Introduction
=======================================

NetCDF-4 added support for a variable length array type. This is not
supported in classic or 64-bit offset files, or in netCDF-4 files which
were created with the NC_CLASSIC_MODEL flag.

   A variable length array is represented in C as a structure from HDF5,
the nc_vlen_t structure. It contains a len member, which contains the
length of that array, and a pointer to the array.

   So an array of VLEN in C is an array of nc_vlen_t structures.

   VLEN arrays are handled differently with respect to allocation of
memory. Generally, when reading data, it is up to the user to malloc
(and subsequently free) the memory needed to hold the data. It is up to
the user to ensure that enough memory is allocated.

   With VLENs, this is impossible. The user cannot know the size of an
array of VLEN until after reading the array. Therefore when reading
VLEN arrays, the netCDF library will allocate the memory for the data
within each VLEN.

   It is up to the user, however, to eventually free this memory. This
is not just a matter of one call to free, with the pointer to the array
of VLENs; each VLEN contains a pointer which must be freed.

   When dynamically allocating space to hold an array of VLEN, allocate
storage for an array of nc_vlen_t.

   Compression is permitted but may not be effective for VLEN data,
because the compression is applied to the nc_vlen_t structs, rather
than the actual data.

`name'
     A name for the VLEN type.

`base_typeid'

5.24 Releasing Memory for a Variable Length Array (VLEN) Type: nc_free_vlen
===========================================================================

When a VLEN is read into user memory from the file, the HDF5 library
performs memory allocations for each of the variable length arrays
contained within the VLEN structure. This memory must be freed by the
user to avoid memory leaks.

   This violates the normal netCDF expectation that the user is
responsible for all memory allocation. But, with VLEN arrays, the
underlying HDF5 library allocates the memory for the user, and the user
is responsible for deallocating that memory.

   To save the user the trouble calling free() on each element of the
VLEN array (i.e. the array of arrays), the nc_free_vlen function is
provided.

Usage
=====

     int nc_free_vlen(nc_vlen_t *vl);

`vl'
     A pointer to the variable length array structure which is to be
     freed.


Errors
======

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_EBADTYPE'
     Can't find the typeid.


Example
=======

This example is from test program libsrc4/tst_vl.c.

        /* Free the memory used in our phony data. */
        for (i=0; i<DIM_LEN; i++)
           if (nc_free_vlen(&data[i])) ERR;

is responsible for deallocating that memory.

   To save the user the trouble calling free() on each element of the
VLEN array (i.e. the array of arrays), the nc_free_vlens function is
provided. It frees all the vlens in an array.

Usage
=====

     int nc_free_vlens(size_t len, nc_vlen_t vlens[])

`len'
     Length of the VLEN array to be freed.

5.26 Opaque Type Introduction
=============================

NetCDF-4 added support for the opaque type. This is not supported in
classic or 64-bit offset files.

   The opaque type is a type which is a collection of objects of a known
size. (And each object is the same size). Nothing is known to netCDF
about the contents of these blobs of data, except their size in bytes,
and the name of the type.

   To use an opaque type, first define it with *note nc_def_opaque::. If
encountering an enum type in a new data file, use *note nc_inq_opaque::
to learn its name and size.

5.32 Learn About a Enum Type: nc_inq_enum
=========================================

Get information about a user-define enumeration type.

Usage
=====

     nc_inq_enum(int ncid, nc_type xtype, char *name, nc_type *base_nc_typep,
                 size_t *base_sizep, size_t *num_membersp);

`xtype'
     The typeid for this enum type, as returned by nc_def_enum, or
     nc_inq_var.

`name'
     Pointer to an already allocated char array which will get the
     name, as a null terminated string. It will have a maximum length of
     NC_MAX_NAME+1.

`base_nc_typep'
     If non-NULL, a pointer to a nc_type, which will get the base
     integer type of this enum.

`base_sizep'
     If non-NULL, a size_t pointer, which will get the size (in bytes)
     of the base integer type of this enum.

`num_membersp'

one element for each of the nine members of the Brady family on a
popular American television show which occupies far too much memory
space in my brain!

6.1 Introduction
================

Variables for a netCDF dataset are defined when the dataset is created,
while the netCDF dataset is in define mode. Other variables may be
added later by reentering define mode. A netCDF variable has a name, a
type, and a shape, which are specified when it is defined. A variable
may also have values, which are established later in data mode.

   Ordinarily, the name, type, and shape are fixed when the variable is
first defined. The name may be changed, but the type and shape of a
variable cannot be changed. However, a variable defined in terms of the
unlimited dimension can grow without bound in that dimension.

   A netCDF variable in an open netCDF dataset is referred to by a small
integer called a variable ID.

   Variable IDs reflect the order in which variables were defined within
a netCDF dataset. Variable IDs are 0, 1, 2,..., in the order in which
the variables were defined. A function is available for getting the
variable ID from the variable name and vice-versa.

   Attributes (*note Attributes::) may be associated with a variable to
specify such properties as units.

   Operations supported on variables are:
   * Create a variable, given its name, data type, and shape.

   * Get a variable ID from its name.

   * Get a variable's name, data type, shape, and number of attributes
     from its ID.

   * Put a data value into a variable, given variable ID, indices, and
     value.

   * Put an array of values into a variable, given variable ID, corner
     indices, edge lengths, and a block of values.

   * Put a subsampled or mapped array-section of values into a variable,
     given variable ID, corner indices, edge lengths, stride vector,
     index mapping vector, and a block of values.

   * Get a data value from a variable, given variable ID and indices.

   * Get an array of values from a variable, given variable ID, corner
     indices, and edge lengths.

   * Get a subsampled or mapped array-section of values from a variable,
     given variable ID, corner indices, edge lengths, stride vector, and
     index mapping vector.

   * Rename a variable.

6.2 Language Types Corresponding to netCDF external data types
==============================================================

NetCDF supported six atomic data types through version 3.6.0 (char,
byte, short, int, float, and double). Starting with version 4.0, many
new atomic and user defined data types are supported (unsigned int
types, strings, compound types, variable length arrays, enums, opaque).

   The additional data types are only supported in netCDF-4/HDF5 files.
To create netCDF-4/HDF5 files, use the HDF5 flag in nc_create. (*note
nc_create::).

6.3 NetCDF-3 Classic and 64-Bit Offset Data Types
=================================================

NetCDF-3 classic and 64-bit offset files support 6 atomic data types,
and none of the user defined datatype introduced in NetCDF-4.

   The following table gives the netCDF-3 external data types and the
corresponding type constants for defining variables in the C interface:

Type               C #define                                   Bits
byte               NC_BYTE                                     8
char               NC_CHAR                                     8
short              NC_SHORT                                    16
int                NC_INT                                      32
float              NC_FLOAT                                    32
double             NC_DOUBLE                                   64

   The first column gives the netCDF external data type, which is the
same as the CDL data type. The next column gives the corresponding C
pre-processor macro for use in netCDF functions (the pre-processor
macros are defined in the netCDF C header-file netcdf.h). The last
column gives the number of bits used in the external representation of
values of the corresponding type.

6.4 NetCDF-4 Atomic Types
=========================

NetCDF-4 files support all of the atomic data types from netCDF-3, plus
additional unsigned integer types, 64-bit integer types, and a string
type.

Type               C #define                                   Bits

unsigned long long NC_UINT64^                                  64
long long          NC_INT64^                                   64
float              NC_FLOAT                                    32
double             NC_DOUBLE                                   64

   ^This type was introduced in netCDF-4, and is not supported in netCDF
classic or 64-bit offset format files, or in netCDF-4 files if they are
created with the NC_CLASSIC_MODEL flags.

6.5 Create a Variable: `nc_def_var'
===================================

The function nc_def_var adds a new variable to an open netCDF dataset
in define mode. It returns (as an argument) a variable ID, given the
netCDF ID, the variable name, the variable type, the number of
dimensions, and a list of the dimension IDs.

Usage
=====

     int nc_def_var (int ncid, const char *name, nc_type xtype,
                     int ndims, const int dimids[], int *varidp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`name'
     Variable name.

`xtype'
     One of the set of predefined netCDF external data types. The type
     of this parameter, nc_type, is defined in the netCDF header file.
     The valid netCDF external data types are NC_BYTE, NC_CHAR,
     NC_SHORT, NC_INT, NC_FLOAT, and NC_DOUBLE. If the file is a
     NetCDF-4/HDF5 file, the additional types NC_UBYTE, NC_USHORT,
     NC_UINT, NC_INT64, NC_UINT64, and NC_STRING may be used, as well
     as a user defined type ID.

`ndims'
     Number of dimensions for the variable. For example, 2 specifies a
     matrix, 1 specifies a vector, and 0 means the variable is a scalar
     with no dimensions. Must not be negative or greater than the
     predefined constant NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS.

`dimids'
     Vector of ndims dimension IDs corresponding to the variable
     dimensions. For classic model netCDF files, if the ID of the
     unlimited dimension is included, it must be first. This argument
     is ignored if ndims is 0. For expanded model netCDF4/HDF5 files,
     there may be any number of unlimited dimensions, and they may be
     used in any element of the dimids array.

`varidp'
     Pointer to location for the returned variable ID.


Errors
======

nc_def_var returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred. Otherwise,
the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of errors
include:

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_BADID'
     Bad ncid.

`NC_ENOTINDEFINE'
     Not in define mode. This is returned for netCDF classic or 64-bit
     offset files, or for netCDF-4 files, when they were been created
     with NC_STRICT_NC3 flag. (*note nc_create::).

`NC_ESTRICTNC3'
     Trying to create a var some place other than the root group in a
     netCDF file with NC_STRICT_NC3 turned on.

`NC_MAX_VARS'
     Max number of variables exceeded in a classic or 64-bit offset
     file, or an netCDF-4 file with NC_STRICT_NC3 on.

`NC_EBADTYPE'
     Bad type.

`NC_EINVAL'
     Number of dimensions to large.

`NC_ENAMEINUSE'
     Name already in use.

`NC_EPERM'
     Attempt to create object in read-only file.


Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_def_var to create a variable named rh of
type double with three dimensions, time, lat, and lon in a new netCDF
dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;                       /* error status */
     int  ncid;                         /* netCDF ID */
     int  lat_dim, lon_dim, time_dim;   /* dimension IDs */
     int  rh_id;                        /* variable ID */
     int  rh_dimids[3];                 /* variable shape */
        ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
                                        /* define dimensions */
     status = nc_def_dim(ncid, "lat", 5L, &lat_dim);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

6.6 Define Chunking Parameters for a Variable: `nc_def_var_chunking'
====================================================================

The function nc_def_var_chunking sets the chunking parameters for a
variable in a netCDF-4 file.  It can set the chunk sizes to get chunked
storage, or it can set the contiguous flag to get contiguous storage.

   Variables that make use of one or more unlimited dimensions,
compression, or checksums must use chunking.  Such variables are
created with default chunk sizes of 1 for each unlimited dimension and
the dimension length for other dimensions, except that if the resulting
chunks are too large, the default chunk sizes for non-record dimensions
are reduced.

   The total size of a chunk must be less than 4 GiB. That is, the
product of all chunksizes and the size of the data (or the size of
nc_vlen_t for VLEN types) must be less than 4 GiB.

   This function may only be called after the variable is defined, but
before nc_enddef is called.  Once the chunking parameters are set for a
variable, they cannot be changed.  This function can be used to change
the default chunking for record, compressed, or checksummed variables
before nc_enddef is called.

   Note that you cannot set chunking for scalar variables. Only
non-scalar variables can have chunking.

Usage
=====

     int nc_def_var_chunking(int ncid, int varid, int storage, size_t *chunksizesp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`storage'
     If NC_CONTIGUOUS, then contiguous storage is used for this
     variable. Variables with chunking, compression, checksums, or one
     or more unlimited dimensions cannot use contiguous storage.

     If NC_CHUNKED, then chunked storage is used for this variable.
     Chunk sizes may be specified with the chunksizes parameter or
     default sizes will be used if that parameter is NULL.

     By default contiguous storage is used for fix-sized variables when
     conpression, chunking, and checksums are not used.

`*chunksizes'
     A pointer to an array list of chunk sizes. The array must have one
     chunksize for each dimension of the variable.


Errors
======

nc_def_var_chunking returns the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error.

   Possible return codes include:

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_EBADID'
     Bad ncid.

`NC_EINVAL'
     Invalid input. This can occur if contiguous storage is set on a
     variable which uses compression, checksums, or one or more
     unlimited dimensions.

`NC_ENOTNC4'
     Not a netCDF-4 file.

`NC_ENOTVAR'
     Can't find this variable.

`NC_ELATEDEF'
     This variable has already been the subject of a nc_enddef call. In
     netCDF-4 files nc_enddef will be called automatically for any data
     read or write. Once nc_enddef has been called after the nc_def_var
     call for a variable, it is impossible to set the chunking for that
     variable.

`NC_ENOTINDEFINE'
     Not in define mode. This is returned for netCDF classic or 64-bit
     offset files, or for netCDF-4 files, when they were been created
     with NC_STRICT_NC3 flag. (*note nc_create::).

`NC_ESTRICTNC3'
     Trying to create a var some place other than the root group in a
     netCDF file with NC_STRICT_NC3 turned on.

`NC_EPERM'
     Attempt to create object in read-only file.

6.8 Set HDF5 Chunk Cache for a Variable: nc_set_var_chunk_cache
===============================================================

This function changes the chunk cache settings for a variable. The
change in cache size happens immediately. This is a property of the
open file - it does not persist the next time you open the file.

   For more information, see the documentation for the H5Pset_cache()
function in the HDF5 library at the HDF5 website:
`http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/'.

Usage
=====

     nc_set_var_chunk_cache(int ncid, int varid, size_t size, size_t nelems,
     		       float preemption);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`size'
     The total size of the raw data chunk cache, in bytes. This should
     be big enough to hold multiple chunks of data.

`nelems'
     The number of chunk slots in the raw data chunk cache hash table.
     This should be a prime number larger than the number of chunks
     that will be in the cache.

`preemption'
     The preemtion value must be between 0 and 1 inclusive and indicates
     how much chunks that have been fully read are favored for
     preemption. A value of zero means fully read chunks are treated no
     differently than other chunks (the preemption is strictly LRU)
     while a value of one means fully read chunks are always preempted
     before other chunks.


Return Codes
============

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_EINVAL'
     Preemption must be between zero and one (inclusive).

6.10 Define Fill Parameters for a Variable: `nc_def_var_fill'
=============================================================

The function nc_def_var_fill sets the fill parameters for a variable in
a netCDF-4 file.

   This function must be called after the variable is defined, but
before nc_enddef is called.

Usage
=====

     int nc_def_var_fill(int ncid, int varid, int no_fill, void *fill_value);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`no_fill'
     Set no_fill mode on a variable. When this mode is on, fill values
     will not be written for the variable. This is helpful in high
     performance applications. For netCDF-4/HDF5 files (whether classic
     model or not), this may only be changed after the variable is
     defined, but before it is committed to disk (i.e. before the first
     nc_enddef after the nc_def_var.) For classic and 64-bit offset
     file, the no_fill mode may be turned on and off at any time.

`*fill_value'
     A pointer to a value which will be used as the fill value for the
     variable. Must be the same type as the variable. This will be
     written to a _FillValue attribute, created for this purpose. If
     NULL, this argument will be ignored.


Return Codes
============

`NC_NOERR'
     No error.

`NC_BADID'
     Bad ncid.

`NC_ENOTNC4'
     Not a netCDF-4 file.

`NC_ENOTVAR'
     Can't find this variable.

`NC_ELATEDEF'
     This variable has already been the subject of a nc_enddef call. In
     netCDF-4 files nc_enddef will be called automatically for any data
     read or write. Once enddef has been called, it is impossible to set
     the fill for a variable.

`NC_ENOTINDEFINE'
     Not in define mode. This is returned for netCDF classic or 64-bit
     offset files, or for netCDF-4 files, when they were been created
     with NC_STRICT_NC3 flag. (*note nc_create::).

`NC_EPERM'
     Attempt to create object in read-only file.

=========================================================

The function nc_def_var_endian sets the endianness for a variable in a
netCDF-4 file.

   This function must be called after the variable is defined, but

   By default, netCDF-4 variables are in native endianness. That is,
they are big-endian on a big-endian machine, and little-endian on a
little endian machine.

   In some cases a user might wish to change from native endianness to
either big or little-endianness. This function allows them to do that.

Usage

6.20 Get Information about a Variable from Its ID: nc_inq_var
=============================================================

family &findex nc_inq_vardimid 

   A family of functions that returns information about a netCDF
variable, given its ID. Information about a variable includes its name,
type, number of dimensions, a list of dimension IDs describing the
shape of the variable, and the number of variable attributes that have
been assigned to the variable.

   The function nc_inq_var returns all the information about a netCDF
variable, given its ID. The other functions each return just one item
of information about a variable.

   These other functions include nc_inq_varname, nc_inq_vartype,
nc_inq_varndims, nc_inq_vardimid, and nc_inq_varnatts.

Usage
=====

     int nc_inq_var      (int ncid, int varid, char *name, nc_type *xtypep,
                          int *ndimsp, int dimids[], int *nattsp);
     int nc_inq_varname  (int ncid, int varid, char *name);
     int nc_inq_vartype  (int ncid, int varid, nc_type *xtypep);
     int nc_inq_varndims (int ncid, int varid, int *ndimsp);
     int nc_inq_vardimid (int ncid, int varid, int dimids[]);
     int nc_inq_varnatts (int ncid, int varid, int *nattsp);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`name'
     Returned variable name. The caller must allocate space for the
     returned name. The maximum possible length, in characters, of a
     variable name is given by the predefined constant NC_MAX_NAME.
     (This doesn't include the null terminator, so declare your array
     to be size NC_MAX_NAME+1). The returned character array will be
     null-terminated.

`xtypep'
     Pointer to location for returned variable type, one of the set of
     predefined netCDF external data types. The type of this parameter,
     nc_type, is defined in the netCDF header file. The valid netCDF
     external data types are NC_BYTE, NC_CHAR, NC_SHORT, NC_INT,
     NC_FLOAT, and NC_DOUBLE.

`ndimsp'
     Pointer to location for returned number of dimensions the variable
     was defined as using. For example, 2 indicates a matrix, 1
     indicates a vector, and 0 means the variable is a scalar with no
     dimensions.

`dimids'
     Returned vector of *ndimsp dimension IDs corresponding to the
     variable dimensions. The caller must allocate enough space for a
     vector of at least *ndimsp integers to be returned. The maximum
     possible number of dimensions for a variable is given by the
     predefined constant NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS.

`nattsp'
     Pointer to location for returned number of variable attributes
     assigned to this variable.

   These functions return the value NC_NOERR if no errors occurred.
Otherwise, the returned status indicates an error. Possible causes of
errors include:

   The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF dataset.  The
specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_inq_var to find out about a variable named
rh in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status                        /* error status */
     int  ncid;                         /* netCDF ID */
     int  rh_id;                        /* variable ID */
     nc_type rh_type;                   /* variable type */
     int rh_ndims;                      /* number of dims */
     int  rh_dimids[NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS];   /* dimension IDs */
     int rh_natts                       /* number of attributes */

        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid, "rh", &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     /* we don't need name, since we already know it */
     status = nc_inq_var (ncid, rh_id, 0, &rh_type, &rh_ndims, rh_dimids,
                          &rh_natts);

6.21 Write a Single Data Value: nc_put_var1_ TYPE
=================================================

The functions nc_put_var1_ TYPE put a single data value of the
specified type into a variable of an open netCDF dataset that is in
data mode. Inputs are the netCDF ID, the variable ID, an index that
specifies which value to add or alter, and the data value. The value is
converted to the external data type of the variable, if necessary.

   The functions for types ubyte, ushort, uint, longlong, ulonglong, and
string are only available for netCDF-4/HDF5 files.

   The nc_put_var1() function will write a variable of any type,
including user defined type. For this function, the type of the data in
memory must match the type of the variable - no data conversion is done.

Usage
=====

     int nc_put_var1_text  (int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            const char *tp);

     int nc_put_var1_double(int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],
                            const double *dp);
     int nc_put_var1_ushort(int ncid, int varid, const size_t index[],

     int nc_put_var1(int ncid, int varid, const size_t *indexp,
                     const void *op);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`index[]'
     The index of the data value to be written. The indices are relative
     to 0, so for example, the first data value of a two-dimensional
     variable would have index (0,0). The elements of index must
     correspond to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the variable
     uses the unlimited dimension, the first index would correspond to
     the unlimited dimension.

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to the data value to be written. If the type of data values
     differs from the netCDF variable type, type conversion will occur.
     *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type Conversion.


Return Codes
============

   * NC_NOERR No error.

   * NC_EHDFERR Error reported by HDF5 layer.

   * NC_ENOTVAR The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF
     dataset.

   * NC_EINVALCOORDS The specified indices were out of range for the
     rank of the specified variable. For example, a negative index or
     an index that is larger than the corresponding dimension length
     will cause an error.

   * NC_ERANGE The specified value is out of the range of values
     representable by the external data type of the variable. (Does not
     apply to nc_put_var1() function).

   * NC_EINDEFINE The specified netCDF is in define mode rather than
     data mode.

   * NC_EBADID The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF
     dataset.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_put_var1_double to set the (1,2,3) element
of the variable named rh to 0.5 in an existing netCDF dataset named
foo.nc. For simplicity in this example, we assume that we know that rh
is dimensioned with time, lat, and lon, so we want to set the value of
rh that corresponds to the second time value, the third lat value, and
the fourth lon value:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;                          /* error status */
     int  ncid;                            /* netCDF ID */
     int  rh_id;                           /* variable ID */
     static size_t rh_index[] = {1, 2, 3}; /* where to put value */
     static double rh_val = 0.5;           /* value to put */
        ...

     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid (ncid, "rh", &rh_id);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_put_var1_double(ncid, rh_id, rh_index, &rh_val);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

6.22 Write an Entire Variable: nc_put_var_ TYPE
===============================================

The nc_put_var_ TYPE family of functions write all the values of a
variable into a netCDF variable of an open netCDF dataset. This is the
simplest interface to use for writing a value in a scalar variable or
whenever all the values of a multidimensional variable can all be
written at once. The values to be written are associated with the
netCDF variable by assuming that the last dimension of the netCDF
variable varies fastest in the C interface. The values are converted to
the external data type of the variable, if necessary.

   Take care when using the simplest forms of this interface with record
variables (variables that use the NC_UNLIMITED dimension) when you
don't specify how many records are to be written. If you try to write
all the values of a record variable into a netCDF file that has no
record data yet (hence has 0 records), nothing will be written.
Similarly, if you try to write all the values of a record variable but
there are more records in the file than you assume, more in-memory data
will be accessed than you supply, which may result in a segmentation
violation.  To avoid such problems, it is better to use the nc_put_vara
interfaces for variables that use the NC_UNLIMITED dimension.  *Note
nc_put_vara_ type::.

   The functions for types ubyte, ushort, uint, longlong, ulonglong, and
string are only available for netCDF-4/HDF5 files.

   The nc_put_var() function will write a variable of any type,
including user defined type. For this function, the type of the data in
memory must match the type of the variable - no data conversion is done.

6.23 Write an Array of Values: nc_put_vara_ TYPE
================================================

The function nc_put_vara_ TYPE writes values into a netCDF variable of
an open netCDF dataset. The part of the netCDF variable to write is
specified by giving a corner and a vector of edge lengths that refer to
an array section of the netCDF variable. The values to be written are
associated with the netCDF variable by assuming that the last dimension
of the netCDF variable varies fastest in the C interface. The netCDF
dataset must be in data mode.

   The functions for types ubyte, ushort, uint, longlong, ulonglong, and
string are only available for netCDF-4/HDF5 files.

   The nc_put_var() function will write a variable of any type,
including user defined type. For this function, the type of the data in
memory must match the type of the variable - no data conversion is done.

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`start'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the index in the variable
     where the first of the data values will be written. The indices are
     relative to 0, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (0, 0, ... , 0). The size of start must be the
     same as the number of dimensions of the specified variable. The
     elements of start must correspond to the variable's dimensions in
     order. Hence, if the variable is a record variable, the first
     index would correspond to the starting record number for writing
     the data values.

`count'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the edge lengths along each
     dimension of the block of data values to be written. To write a
     single value, for example, specify count as (1, 1, ... , 1). The
     length of count is the number of dimensions of the specified
     variable. The elements of count correspond to the variable's
     dimensions. Hence, if the variable is a record variable, the first
     element of count corresponds to a count of the number of records
     to write.

     Note: setting any element of the count array to zero causes the
     function to exit without error, and without doing anything.

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to a block of contiguous data values to be written. The
     order in which the data will be written to the netCDF variable is
     with the last dimension of the specified variable varying fastest.
     If the type of data values differs from the netCDF variable type,
     type conversion will occur. *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type
     Conversion.


Return Codes
============

   * NC_NOERR No error.

   * NC_EHDFERR Error reported by HDF5 layer.

   * NC_ENOTVAR The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF
     dataset.

   * NC_EINVALCOORDS The specified corner indices were out of range for
     the rank of the specified variable. For example, a negative index,
     or an index that is larger than the corresponding dimension length
     will cause an error.

   * NC_EEDGE The specified edge lengths added to the specified corner
     would have referenced data out of range for the rank of the
     specified variable. For example, an edge length that is larger
     than the corresponding dimension length minus the corner index
     will cause an error.

   * NC_ERANGE One or more of the specified values are out of the range
     of values representable by the external data type of the variable.
     (Does not apply to the nc_put_vara() function).

   * NC_EINDEFINE The specified netCDF dataset is in define mode rather

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`start'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the index in the variable
     where the first of the data values will be written. The indices are
     relative to 0, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (0, 0, ... , 0). The elements of start
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first index corresponds to the
     starting record number for writing the data values.

`count'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the number of indices
     selected along each dimension. To write a single value, for
     example, specify count as (1, 1, ... , 1). The elements of count
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first element of count
     corresponds to a count of the number of records to write.

     Note: setting any element of the count array to zero causes the
     function to exit without error, and without doing anything.

`stride'
     A vector of ptrdiff_t integers that specifies the sampling interval
     along each dimension of the netCDF variable. The elements of the
     stride vector correspond, in order, to the netCDF variable's
     dimensions (stride[0] gives the sampling interval along the most
     slowly varying dimension of the netCDF variable). Sampling
     intervals are specified in type-independent units of elements (a
     value of 1 selects consecutive elements of the netCDF variable
     along the corresponding dimension, a value of 2 selects every
     other element, etc.). A NULL stride argument is treated as (1, 1,
     ... , 1).

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to a block of contiguous data values to be written. The
     order in which the data will be written to the netCDF variable is
     with the last dimension of the specified variable varying fastest.
     If the type of data values differs from the netCDF variable type,
     type conversion will occur. *Note Type Conversion: (netcdf)Type
     Conversion.

6.25 Write a Mapped Array of Values: nc_put_varm_ TYPE
======================================================

The nc_put_varm_ TYPE family of functions writes a mapped array section
of values into a netCDF variable of an open netCDF dataset. The mapped
array section is specified by giving a corner, a vector of counts, a
stride vector, and an index mapping vector. The index mapping vector is
a vector of integers that specifies the mapping between the dimensions
of a netCDF variable and the in-memory structure of the internal data
array. No assumptions are made about the ordering or length of the
dimensions of the data array. The netCDF dataset must be in data mode.

   The functions for types ubyte, ushort, uint, longlong, ulonglong, and
string are only available for netCDF-4/HDF5 files.

     n

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`start'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the index in the variable
     where the first of the data values will be written. The indices are
     relative to 0, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (0, 0, ... , 0). The elements of start
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first index corresponds to the
     starting record number for writing the data values.

`count'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the number of indices
     selected along each dimension. To write a single value, for
     example, specify count as (1, 1, ... , 1). The elements of count
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first element of count
     corresponds to a count of the number of records to write.

     Note: setting any element of the count array to zero causes the
     function to exit without error, and without doing anything.

`stride'
     A vector of ptrdiff_t integers that specifies the sampling interval
     along each dimension of the netCDF variable. The elements of the
     stride vector correspond, in order, to the netCDF variable's
     dimensions (stride[0] gives the sampling interval along the most
     slowly varying dimension of the netCDF variable). Sampling
     intervals are specified in type-independent units of elements (a
     value of 1 selects consecutive elements of the netCDF variable
     along the corresponding dimension, a value of 2 selects every
     other element, etc.). A NULL stride argument is treated as (1, 1,
     ... , 1).

`imap'
     A vector of ptrdiff_t integers that specifies the mapping between
     the dimensions of a netCDF variable and the in-memory structure of
     the internal data array. The elements of the index mapping vector
     correspond, in order, to the netCDF variable's dimensions (imap[0]
     gives the distance between elements of the internal array
     corresponding to the most slowly varying dimension of the netCDF
     variable). Distances between elements are specified in
     type-independent units of elements (the distance between internal
     elements that occupy adjacent memory locations is 1 and not the
     element's byte-length as in netCDF 2). A NULL argument means the
     memory-resident values have the same structure as the associated
     netCDF variable.

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to the location used for computing where the data values
     will be found; the data should be of the type appropriate for the
     function called. If the type of data values differs from the
     netCDF variable type, type conversion will occur. *Note Type
     Conversion: (netcdf)Type Conversion.

Example
=======

The following imap vector maps in the trivial way a 4x3x2 netCDF
variable and an internal array of the same shape:

     float a[4][3][2];       /* same shape as netCDF variable */
     int   imap[3] = {6, 2, 1};
                             /* netCDF dimension       inter-element distance */
                             /* ----------------       ---------------------- */
                             /* most rapidly varying       1                  */
                             /* intermediate               2 (=imap[2]*2)     */
                             /* most slowly varying        6 (=imap[1]*3)     */

   Using the imap vector above with nc_put_varm_float obtains the same
result as simply using nc_put_var_float.

   Here is an example of using nc_put_varm_float to write - from a
transposed, internal array - a netCDF variable named rh which is
described by the C declaration float rh[6][4] (note the size and order
of the dimensions):

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     #define NDIM 2               /* rank of netCDF variable */
     int ncid;                    /* netCDF ID */
     int status;                  /* error status */
     int rhid;                    /* variable ID */
     static size_t start[NDIM]    /* netCDF variable start point: */
                      = {0, 0};   /* first element */
     static size_t count[NDIM]    /* size of internal array: entire netCDF */
                      = {6, 4};   /* variable; order corresponds to netCDF */
                                  /* variable -- not internal array */
     static ptrdiff_t stride[NDIM]/* variable subsampling intervals: */
                      = {1, 1};   /* sample every netCDF element */
     static ptrdiff_t imap[NDIM]  /* internal array inter-element distances; */
                      = {1, 6};   /* would be {4, 1} if not transposing */
     float rh[4][6];              /* note transposition of netCDF variable */
                                  /* dimensions */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", &rhid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_put_varm_float(ncid, rhid, start, count, stride, imap, rh);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

   Here is another example of using nc_put_varm_float to write - from a
transposed, internal array - a subsample of the same netCDF variable,
by writing every other point of the netCDF variable:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     #define NDIM 2                /* rank of netCDF variable */
     int ncid;                     /* netCDF ID */
     int status;                   /* error status */
     int rhid;                     /* variable ID */
     static size_t start[NDIM]     /* netCDF variable start point: */
                      = {0, 0};    /* first element */
     static size_t count[NDIM]     /* size of internal array: entire */
                        = {3, 2};  /* (subsampled) netCDF variable; order of */
                                   /* dimensions corresponds to netCDF */
                                   /* variable -- not internal array */
     static ptrdiff_t stride[NDIM] /* variable subsampling intervals: */
                      = {2, 2};    /* sample every other netCDF element */
     static ptrdiff_t imap[NDIM]   /* internal array inter-element distances; */
                      = {1, 3};    /* would be {2, 1} if not transposing */
     float rh[2][3];               /* note transposition of (subsampled) */
                                   /* netCDF variable dimensions */
        ...
     status = nc_open("foo.nc", NC_WRITE, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_inq_varid(ncid, "rh", &rhid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
        ...
     status = nc_put_varm_float(ncid, rhid, start, count, stride, imap, rh);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);

6.26 Read a Single Data Value: nc_get_var1_ TYPE
================================================

The functions nc_get_var1_ TYPE get a single data value from a variable
of an open netCDF dataset that is in data mode. Inputs are the netCDF
ID, the variable ID, a multidimensional index that specifies which
value to get, and the address of a location into which the data value
will be read. The value is converted from the external data type of the
variable, if necessary.

   The functions for types ubyte, ushort, uint, longlong, ulonglong, and
string are only available for netCDF-4/HDF5 files.

   The nc_get_var1() function will read a variable of any type,
including user defined type. For this function, the type of the data in
memory must match the type of the variable - no data conversion is done.

Example
=======

Here is an example using nc_get_var1_double to get the (1,2,3) element
of the variable named rh in an existing netCDF dataset named foo.nc.
For simplicity in this example, we assume that we know that rh is
dimensioned with time, lat, and lon, so we want to get the value of rh
that corresponds to the second time value, the third lat value, and the
fourth lon value:

     #include <netcdf.h>
        ...
     int  status;                           /* error status */

6.27 Read an Entire Variable nc_get_var_ TYPE
=============================================

The members of the nc_get_var_ TYPE family of functions read all the
values from a netCDF variable of an open netCDF dataset. This is the
simplest interface to use for reading the value of a scalar variable or
when all the values of a multidimensional variable can be read at once.
The values are read into consecutive locations with the last dimension
varying fastest. The netCDF dataset must be in data mode.

   Take care when using the simplest forms of this interface with record
variables (variables that use the NC_UNLIMITED dimension) when you
don't specify how many records are to be read. If you try to read all
the values of a record variable into an array but there are more
records in the file than you assume, more data will be read than you
expect, which may cause a segmentation violation. To avoid such
problems, it is better to use the nc_get_vara interfaces for variables
that use the NC_UNLIMITED dimension.  *Note nc_get_vara_ type::.

   The functions for types ubyte, ushort, uint, longlong, ulonglong, and
string are only available for netCDF-4/HDF5 files.

   The nc_get_var() function will read a variable of any type,
including user defined type. For this function, the type of the data in
memory must match the type of the variable - no data conversion is done.

6.28 Read an Array of Values: nc_get_vara_ TYPE
===============================================

The members of the nc_get_vara_ TYPE family of functions read an array
of values from a netCDF variable of an open netCDF dataset. The array
is specified by giving a corner and a vector of edge lengths. The
values are read into consecutive locations with the last dimension
varying fastest. The netCDF dataset must be in data mode.

   The functions for types ubyte, ushort, uint, longlong, ulonglong, and
string are only available for netCDF-4/HDF5 files.

   The nc_get_vara() function will write a variable of any type,
including user defined type. For this function, the type of the data in
memory must match the type of the variable - no data conversion is done.

Usage
=====

     int nc_get_vara_text  (int ncid, int varid, const size_t start[],
                            const size_t count[], char *tp);

     int nc_get_vara_short (int ncid, int varid, const size_t start[],
                            const size_t count[], short *sp);
     int nc_get_vara_int   (int ncid, int varid, const size_t start[],
                            const size_t count[], int *ip);
     int nc_get_vara_long  (int ncid, int varid, const size_t start[],
                            const size_t count[], long *lp);
     int nc_get_vara_float (int ncid, int varid, const size_t start[],
                            const size_t count[], float *fp);

     int nc_get_vara_ushort(int ncid, int varid, const size_t *startp,
                            const size_t *countp, unsigned short *ip);
     int nc_get_vara_uint  (int ncid, int varid, const size_t *startp,
                            const size_t *countp, unsigned int *ip);
     int nc_get_vara_longlong(int ncid, int varid, const size_t *startp,
                              const size_t *countp, long long *ip);
     int nc_get_vara_ulonglong(int ncid, int varid, const size_t *startp,
                               const size_t *countp, unsigned long long *ip);
     int nc_get_vara_string(int ncid, int varid, const size_t *startp,

                            const size_t count[], void *ip);

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`start'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the index in the variable
     where the first of the data values will be read. The indices are
     relative to 0, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (0, 0, ... , 0). The length of start must be the
     same as the number of dimensions of the specified variable. The
     elements of start correspond, in order, to the variable's
     dimensions. Hence, if the variable is a record variable, the first
     index would correspond to the starting record number for reading
     the data values.

`count'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the edge lengths along each
     dimension of the block of data values to be read. To read a single
     value, for example, specify count as (1, 1, ... , 1). The length of
     count is the number of dimensions of the specified variable. The
     elements of count correspond, in order, to the variable's
     dimensions. Hence, if the variable is a record variable, the first
     element of count corresponds to a count of the number of records to
     read.

     Note: setting any element of the count array to zero causes the
     function to exit without error, and without doing anything.

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to a block of contiguous locations in memory into which
     the data values are read.  If the type of data value differs from
     the netCDF variable type, type conversion will occur. *Note Type
     Conversion: (netcdf)Type Conversion.


Return Codes
============

   * NC_NOERR No error.

   * NC_ENOTVAR The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF
     dataset.

   * NC_EINVALCOORDS The specified corner indices were out of range for
     the rank of the specified variable. For example, a negative index
     or an index that is larger than the corresponding dimension length
     will cause an error.

   * NC_EEDGE The specified edge lengths added to the specified corner
     would have referenced data out of range for the rank of the
     specified variable. For example, an edge length that is larger
     than the corresponding dimension length minus the corner index
     will cause an error.

   * NC_ERANGE One or more of the values are out of the range of values
     representable by the desired type. (Does not apply to
     nc_get_vara() function).

   * NC_EINDEFINE The specified netCDF is in define mode rather than
     data mode.

   * NC_EBADID The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF
     dataset.

6.29 Read a Subsampled Array of Values: nc_get_vars_ TYPE
=========================================================

The nc_get_vars_ TYPE family of functions read a subsampled (strided)
array section of values from a netCDF variable of an open netCDF
dataset. The subsampled array section is specified by giving a corner,
a vector of edge lengths, and a stride vector. The values are read with
the last dimension of the netCDF variable varying fastest. The netCDF
dataset must be in data mode.

   The functions for types ubyte, ushort, uint, longlong, ulonglong, and
string are only available for netCDF-4/HDF5 files.

`ncid'
     NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open or nc_create.

`varid'
     Variable ID.

`start'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the index in the variable
     where the first of the data values will be read. The indices are
     relative to 0, so for example, the first data value of a variable
     would have index (0, 0, ... , 0). The elements of start
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first index corresponds to the
     starting record number for reading the data values.

`count'
     A vector of size_t integers specifying the number of indices
     selected along each dimension. To read a single value, for
     example, specify count as (1, 1, ... , 1). The elements of count
     correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. Hence, if the
     variable is a record variable, the first element of count
     corresponds to a count of the number of records to read.

     Note: setting any element of the count array to zero causes the
     function to exit without error, and without doing anything.

`stride'
     A vector of ptrdiff_t integers specifying, for each dimension, the
     interval between selected indices. The elements of the stride
     vector correspond, in order, to the variable's dimensions. A value
     of 1 accesses adjacent values of the netCDF variable in the
     corresponding dimension; a value of 2 accesses every other value
     of the netCDF variable in the corresponding dimension; and so on.
     A NULL stride argument is treated as (1, 1, ... , 1).

`tp'
`up'
`cp'
`sp'
`ip'
`lp'
`fp'
`dp'
     Pointer to a block of contiguous locations in memory into which
     the data values are read.  If the type of data value differs from
     the netCDF variable type, type conversion will occur. *Note Type
     Conversion: (netcdf)Type Conversion.

   * NC_EHDFERR Error reported by HDF5 layer.

   * NC_ENOTVAR The variable ID is invalid for the specified netCDF

     would have referenced data out of range for the rank of the
     specified variable. For example, an edge length that is larger

     will cause an error.

   * NC_ERANGE One or more of the specified values are out of the range
     of values representable by the external data type of the variable.
