<h2 class="chapter">1 Installing the NetCDF Binaries</h2>

<p><a name="index-binary-install-1"></a><a name="index-installing-binary-distribution-2"></a><a name="index-shared-libraries_002c-using-3"></a>
The easiest way to get netCDF is through a package management program,
such as rpm, yum, adept, and others. NetCDF is available from many
different repositories, including the default Red Hat and Ubuntu
repositories.

   <p>Another way to get netCDF is to get a pre-built binary
distribution. To get them, see <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp</a>.

   <p>To install the binary distribution, uncompress and unpack the tar
file. You will end up with 4 subdirectories, lib, include, man, and
bin.

   <p>The lib subdirectory holds the netCDF libraries (C, Fortran, and
C++). The include directory holds the necessary netcdf.h file (for C),
netcdf.inc (for Fortran), netcdfcpp.h (for C++), and the .mod files
(for Fortran 90). The bin directory holds the ncgen and ncdump
utilities, and the man directory holds the netCDF documentation.

   <p>You can have these directories anywhere you like, and use netCDF. But
when compiling a netCDF program, you will have to tell the linker
where to find the library (e.g. with the -L option of most C
compilers), and you will also have to tell the C pre-processor where
to find the include file (e.g. with the -I option).

   <p>If you are using shared libraries, you will also have to specify the
library location for run-time dynamic linking. See your compiler
documentation. For some general information see the netCDF FAQ &ldquo;How
do I use shared libraries&rdquo; at <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/faq.html#using_shared">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/faq.html#using_shared</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Quick Instructions for Installing NetCDF on Unix</h2>

<p><a name="index-quick-unix-instructions-4"></a><a name="index-shared-libraries_002c-building-5"></a>
Who has time to read long installation manuals these days?

   <p>When building netCDF-4, you must first decide whether to support the
use of HDF5 as a storage format.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Building NetCDF Without HDF5</h3>

<p>If you don't want netCDF-4/HDF5, then build like this:

<pre class="example">     ./configure --prefix=/home/ed/local --disable-netcdf-4
     make check install
</pre>
   <p>(Replace &ldquo;/home/ed/local&rdquo; with the name of the directory where
netCDF is to be installed.)

   <p>If you get the message that netCDF installed correctly, then you are
done!

<h3 class="section">2.2 Building NetCDF With HDF5</h3>

<p>If you want to use the HDF5 storage format, you must have the HDF5
1.8.6 release. You must also have the zlib compression library,
version 1.2.5. Both of these packages are available from the netCDF-4
ftp site at <a href="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4">ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4</a>.

   <p>Make sure you run &ldquo;make check&rdquo; for the HDF5 and zlib
distributions. They are very well-behaved distributions, but sometimes
the build doesn't work (perhaps because of something subtly
misconfigured on the target machine). If one of these libraries is not
working, netCDF will have serious problems.

   <p>Optionally, you can also build netCDF-4 with the szip 2.0 library
(a.k.a. szlib). NetCDF cannot create szipped data files, but can read
HDF5 data files that have used szip.

   <p>There are license restrictions on the use of szip, see the HDF5 web
page: <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/Commercial_szip.html">http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/Commercial_szip.html</a>. These license restrictions
seem to apply to commercial users who are writing data. (Data readers
are not restricted.) But here at NetCDF World Headquarters, in Sunny
Boulder, Colorado, there are no lawyers, only programmers, so please
read the szip documents for the license agreement to see how it
applies to your situation.

   <p>If you wish to use szip, get it from the HDF5 download page:
<a href="http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5//HDF5/release/beta/obtain518.html">http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5//HDF5/release/beta/obtain518.html</a>.

   <p>If &ldquo;make check&rdquo; fails for either zlib or HDF5, the problem must be
resolved before the netCDF-4 installation can continue. For HDF5
problems, send email to the HDF5 help desk:
help@hdfgroup.org.

   <p>Build zlib like this:

<pre class="example">     ./configure --prefix=/home/ed/local
     make check install
</pre>
   <p>Then you build HDF5, specifying the location of the zlib library:

<pre class="example">     ./configure --with-zlib=/home/ed/local --prefix=/home/ed/local
     make check install
</pre>
   <p>Note that for shared libraries, you may need to add the install
directory to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. See the FAQ for
more details on using shared libraries: <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/faq.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/faq.html</a>.

   <p>If you are building HDF5 with szip, then include the &ndash;with-szlib=
option, with the directory holding the szip library.

   <p>After HDF5 is done, build netcdf, specifying the location of the
HDF5, zlib, and (if built into HDF5) the szip header files and
libraries in the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables.

<pre class="example">     CPPFLAGS=-I/home/ed/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/home/ed/local/lib ./configure --prefix=/home/ed/local
     make check install
</pre>
   <p>The configure script will try to find necessary tools in your
path. When you run configure you may optionally use the &ndash;prefix
argument to change the default installation directory. The above
examples install the zlib, HDF5, and netCDF-4 libraries in
/home/ed/local/lib, the header file in /home/ed/local/include, and the
utilities in /home/ed/local/bin.

   <p>The default install root is /usr/local (so there's no need to use the
prefix argument if you want the software installed there).

   <p>If HDF5 and zlib are found on your system, they will be used by netCDF
in the build. To prevent this use the &ndash;disable-netcdf-4 argument to
configure.

   <p>For static build, to use netCDF-4 you must link to all the libraries,
netCDF, HDF5, zlib, and (if used with HDF5 build) szip. This will mean
-L options to your build for the locations of the libraries, and -l
(lower-case L) for the names of the libraries.

   <p>For example, one user reports that she can build other applications
with netCDF-4 by setting the LIBS envoronment variable:

<pre class="example">     LIBS='-L/X/netcdf-4.0/lib -lnetcdf -L/X/hdf5-1.8.6/lib -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lz -lm -L/X/szip-2.1/lib -lsz'
</pre>
   <p>For shared builds, only -lnetcdf is needed. All other libraries will
be found automatically.

   <p>The nc-config command can be used to learn what options are needed for
the local netCDF installation.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Building with HDF4 Support</h3>

<p>The netCDF-4 library can (since version 4.1) read HDF4 data files, if
they were created with the SD (Scientific Data) API. To enable this
feature, use the &ndash;enable-hdf4 option. The location for the HDF4
header files and library must be set in the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
options.

If you wish to build from source on a Windows (Win32) platform,
different instructions apply. See <a href="#Building-on-Windows">Building on Windows</a>.

   <p>Depending on the platform, you may need up to 25 Mbytes of free space
to unpack, build, and run the tests. You will also need a Standard C
compiler. If you have compilers for FORTRAN 77, FORTRAN 90, or C++,
the corresponding netCDF language interfaces may also be built and
tested. Compilers and associated tools will only be found if they are
in your path, or if you specify the path and compiler in the
appropriate environment variable. (Example for csh: setenv
CC /some/directory/cc).

   <p>If you want to run the large file tests, you will need about 13 GB of
free disk space, as some very large files are created. The created
files are immediately deleted after the tests complete. These large
file tests are not run unless the &ndash;enable-large-file-tests option is
used with configure. (The &ndash;with-temp-large option may also be used to
specify a directory to create the large files in).

   <p>Unlike the output from other netCDF test programs, each large test
program deletes its output before successfully exiting.

   <p>To use the netCDF-4 features you will also need to have a
HDF5-1.8.6 release installed. HDF5, in turn, must have been
built with zlib, version 1.2.5.

   <p>A tested version of HDF5 and zlib can be found at the netCDF-4 ftp
site at <a href="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4">ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4</a>.

   <p>For more information about HDF5 see the HDF5 web site at
<a href="http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/</a>. For more information about zlib see the zlib
web site at <a href="http://www.zlib.net">http://www.zlib.net</a>.

   <p>To use the DAP features you will also need to have a version of
libcurl (version 7.18.0 or later) installed.  Depending on how this
library was built, you may also need zib (version 1.2.5 or later). 
Information about libcurl may be obtained at <a href="http://curl.haxx.se">http://curl.haxx.se</a>.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Specifying the Environment for Building</h3>

<p>The netCDF configure script searches your path to find the compilers
and tools it needed. To use compilers that can't be found in your
path, set their environment variables.

   <p>The configure script will use gcc and associated GNU tools if they are
found. Many users, especially those with performance concerns, will
wish to use a vendor supplied compiler.

   <p>For example, on an AIX system, users may wish to use xlc (the AIX
compiler) in one of its many flavors. Set environment variables
before the build to achieve this.

   <p>For example, to change the C compiler, set CC to xlc (in sh: export
CC=xlc). (But don't forget to also set CXX to xlC, or else configure
will try to use g++, the GNU C++ compiler to build the netCDF C++
API. Similarly set FC to xlf90 so that the Fortran APIs are built
properly.)

   <p>By default, the netCDF library is built with assertions turned on. If
you wish to turn off assertions, set CPPFLAGS to -DNDEBUG (csh ex:
setenv CPPFLAGS -DNDEBUG).

   <p>If GNU compilers are used, the configure script sets CPPFLAGS to &ldquo;-g
-O2&rdquo;. If this is not desired, set CPPFLAGS to nothing, or to whatever
other value you wish to use, before running configure.

   <p>For cross-compiles, the following environment variables can be used to
override the default fortran/C type settings like this (in sh):

<pre class="example">     export NCBYTE_T=''integer(selected_int_kind(2))''
     export NCSHORT_T=''integer*2''
     export NF_INT1_T=''integer(selected_int_kind(2))''
     export NF_INT2_T=''integer*2''
     export NF_INT1_IS_C_SHORT=1
     export NF_INT2_IS_C_SHORT=1
     export NF_INT_IS_C_INT=1
     export NF_REAL_IS_C_FLOAT=1
     export NF_DOUBLEPRECISION_IS_C_DOUBLE=1
</pre>
   <p>In this case you will need to run configure with
&ndash;disable-fortran-compiler-check and &ndash;disable-fortran-type-check.

<h3 class="section">3.4 Building on Platforms with Parallel I/O</h3>

<p><a name="index-parallel-platforms-17"></a><a name="index-MPICH2-18"></a><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dparallel_002dtests-19"></a>
NetCDF makes available the parallel I/O features of HDF5 and the
parallel-netcdf libraries, allowing parallel I/O from netCDF-4 linked
programs.

<h4 class="subsection">3.4.1 Building HDF5 for Parallel I/O</h4>

<p>For parallel I/O to work, HDF5 must be installed with
&ndash;enable-parallel, and an MPI library (and related libraries) must be
made available to the HDF5 configure. This can be accomplished with
the mpicc wrapper script, in the case of MPICH2.

   <p>The following works to build HDF5 with parallel I/O on our netCDF
testing system:

<pre class="example">     CC=mpicc ./configure --enable-parallel --prefix=/shecky/local_par --with-zlib=/shecky/local_par --disable-shared &amp;&amp; make check install
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">3.4.2 The parallel-netcdf Library</h4>

<p>Optionally, the parallel-netcdf library should also be installed, and
the replacement for pnetcdf.h should be copied from
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/contrib/pnetcdf.h.

<h4 class="subsection">3.4.3 Building NetCDF</h4>

<p>To build netCDF with parallel I/O, build as usual, but point the
configure at a version of HDF5 that has been built for parallel I/O.

<pre class="example">     CPPFLAGS=-I/shecky/local_par/include
     CXXFLAGS=-I/shecky/local_par/include
     FFFLAGS=-I/shecky/local_par/include
     FCFLAGS=-I/shecky/local_par/include LDFLAGS=-L/shecky/local_par/lib
     FC=mpif90 CXX=mpicxx CC=mpicc ./configure
     make check install
</pre>
   <p>To enable the parallel tests, specify &ndash;enable-parallel-tests as an
option to configure. These tests will be run as mpiexec calls. This
may not be appropriate on all systems, especially those which use some
queue for jobs.

   <p>To use parallel-netcdf to perform parallel I/O on classic and 64-bit
offset files, use the &ndash;enable-pnetcdf option.

   <p>For parallel builds the netCDF examples are not built. This is to
avoid cluttering them with MPI_Init/Finalize calls.

<h3 class="section">3.5 Running the configure Script</h3>

<p><a name="index-configure_002c-running-20"></a><a name="index-running-configure-21"></a><a name="index-install-directory-22"></a><a name="index-prefix-argument-of-configure-23"></a><a name="index-config_002elog-24"></a>
To create the Makefiles needed to build netCDF, you must run the
provided configure script. Go to the top-level netCDF directory.

   <p>Decide where you want to install this package. Use this for the
"&ndash;prefix=" argument to the configure script below. The default
installation prefix is &ldquo;/usr/local,&rdquo; which will install the
package's files in usr/local/bin, usr/local/lib, and
usr/local/man. The default can be overridden with the &ndash;prefix
argument to configure.

   <p>Here's how to execute the configure script with a different
installation directory:

<pre class="example">         ./configure --prefix=/whatever/you/decided
</pre>
   <p>The above would cause the netCDF libraries to be installed in
/whatever/you/decided/lib, the header files in
/whatever/you/decided/include, the utilities (ncdump/ncgen) in
/whatever/you/decided/bin, and the man pages in
/whatever/you/decided/man.

   <p>If the configure script finds HDF5 in the system directories, it will
(attempt to) build the netCDF-4 enhanced features. To turn this off
use the &ndash;disable-netcdf-4 option.

   <p>There are other options for the configure script. The most useful ones
are listed below. Use the &ndash;help option to get the full list.

     <dl>
<dt><code>--prefix</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dprefix-25"></a><dd>Specify the directory under which netCDF will be
installed. Subdirectories lib, bin, include, and man will be created
there, if they don't already exist.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-netcdf-4</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dnetcdf_002d4-26"></a><dd>Turn off netCDF-4 features, even if HDF5 library is found.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-shared</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dshared-27"></a><dd>Build static libraries only.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-dap</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002ddap-28"></a><dd>Enable DAP support. This flag is set by default
if the configure script can locate a usable
instance of the curl-config program. 
The curl-config program can be specified explicitly
using &ndash;with-curl-config=/some/path/curl-config,
or configure will attempt some heuristics to locate
the curl-config program; typically by checking
the PATH environment variable. 
If the flag &ndash;enable-dap flag is not set to either &ndash;enable-dap or
&ndash;disable-dap, and a usable curl library can be found,
then DAP support will be enabled by default. 
Note that when DAP is enabled, this can be tested for
in a configure script by looking for the function
&ldquo;nc__opendap&rdquo;.

     <br><dt><code>--with-curl-config</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dwith_002dcurl_002dconfig-29"></a><dd>This flag may be used to specify the curl-config program
so that DAP support can be enabled. 
Note that it should specify the actual program
using something like &ndash;with-curl-config=/some/path/curl-config.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-dap-remote-tests</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002ddap_002dremote_002dtests-30"></a><dd>If DAP support is enabled, then remote tests are
run that utilize the test server at opendap.org. 
This option is enabled by default. 
Since that server may be inaccessible
for a variety of reasons, these tests may fail,
in which case this flag should be disabled.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-dap-long-tests</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002ddap_002dlong_002dtests-31"></a><dd>If &ndash;enable-dap-remote-tests is enabled, then this
flag can also be enabled to add extra tests that may
take signficant time to execute. 
This flag is off by default.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-hdf4</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dhdf4-32"></a><dd>Turns on the HDF4 read layer. This reads HDF4 files created with the
SD (Scientific Data) API of HDF4.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-hdf4-file-tests</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dhdf4_002dfile_002dtests-33"></a><dd>Causes make check to use wget to fetch some HDF4 data files from the
Unidata FTP server, and check that they are properly understood. This
is done as part of automatic netCDF testing, and should not be done by
users.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-pnetcdf</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dpnetcdf-34"></a><dd>Allows parallel I/O with classic and 64-bit offset format files, using
the parallel-netcdf (formerly pnetcdf) library from
Argonne/Northwestern. The parallel-netcdf library must be installed,
and a specially modified pnetcdf.h must be used. (Get it at
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/user/contrib/pnetcdf.h)

     <br><dt><code>--with-udunits</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dwith_002dudunits-35"></a><dd>Builds UDUNITS2 as well as netCDF. The UDUNITS2 package supports units
of physical quantities (e.g., meters, seconds). Specifically, it
supports conversion between string and binary representations of
units, arithmetic manipulation of units, and conversion of numeric
values between compatible units. For more information about UDUNITS,
see: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/

     <br><dt><code>--disable-largefile</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dlargefile-36"></a><dd>This omits OS support for large files (i.e. files larger than 2 GB).

     <br><dt><code>--disable-fortran</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dfortran-37"></a><dd>Turns off Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 API. (Same as &ndash;disable-f77.)

     <br><dt><code>--disable-f77</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002df77-38"></a><dd>This turns off building of the F77 and F90 APIs. (The F90 API cannot
be built without the F77 API). This also disables some of the
configure tests that relate to fortran, including the test of the F90
compiler. Setting the environment variables FC or F77 to NULL will
have the same effect as &ndash;disable-f77.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-f90</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002df90-39"></a><dd>This turns off the building of the F90 API. Setting the environment
variable F90 to null for configure will have the same effect.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-cxx</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dcxx-40"></a><dd>This turns off the building of the C++ API. Setting the environment
variable CXX to null for configure will have the same effect.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-v2</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dv2-41"></a><dd>This turns of the V2 API. The V2 API is completely replaced with the
V3 API, but is usually built with netCDF for backwards compatibility,
and also because the C++ API depends on the V2 API. Setting this has
the effect of automatically turning off the CXX API, as if
&ndash;disable-cxx had also been specified.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-cxx4</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dcxx4-42"></a><dd>Turns on the new C++ API, which is currently under development, and
will expose the full expanded model in the C++ API. The cxx4 API is
experiemental, unfinished, and untested. It is provided for
experiemental purposes only.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-large-file-tests</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dlarge_002dfile_002dtests-43"></a><dd>Turn on tests for large files. These tests create files over 2 GB in
size, and need about 13 GB of free disk space to run. These files are
deleted after the test successfully completes. They will be created in
the netCDF nc_test directory, unless the &ndash;with-temp-large option is
used to specify another location (see below).

     <br><dt><code>--with-temp-large</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dwith_002dtemp_002dlarge-44"></a><dd>Normally large files are not created during the netCDF build, but they
will be if &ndash;enable-large-file-tests is specified (see above). In that
case, this configure parameter can be used to specify a location to
create these large files, for example: &ndash;with-large-files=/tmp/ed.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-benchmarks</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dbenchmarks-45"></a><dd>Turn on tests of the speed of various netCDF operations. Some of these
operations take a long time to run (minutes, on a reasonable
workstation).

     <br><dt><code>--enable-valgrind-tests</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dvalgrind_002dtests-46"></a><dd>Causes some tests to be re-run under valgrind, the memory testing
tool. Valgrind must be present for this to work. Also HDF5 must be
built with &ndash;enable-using-memchecker, and netCDF must be compiled
without optimization (at least on the Unidata test platform where this
is tested). The valgrind tests are run by shell script
libsrc4/run_valgrind_tests.sh. It simply reruns the test programs in
that directory, using valgrind, and with settings such that any error
reported by valgrind will cause the &ldquo;make check&rdquo; to fail.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-fortran-type-check</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dfortran_002dtype_002dcheck-47"></a><dd>The netCDF configure compiles and runs some programs to test fortran
vs. C type sizes. Setting this option turns off those test, and uses a
set of default values (which can be overridden by environment
variables see <a href="#Environment">Environment</a>).

     <br><dt><code>--disable-examples</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddisable_002dexamples-48"></a><dd>Starting with version 3.6.2, netCDF comes with some examples in the
&ldquo;examples&rdquo; directory. By default, the examples are all built during
a &ldquo;make check&rdquo; unless the &ndash;disable-examples option is provided.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-extra-tests</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dextra_002dtests-49"></a><dd>This option may turn on tests which are known to fail (i.e. bugs that
we are currently working to fix).

     <br><dt><code>--with-default-chunk-size</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dwith_002ddefault_002dchunk_002dsize-50"></a><dd>Change the size (in bytes) that will be used as a target size when
computing default chunksizes for netCDF-4/HDF5 chunked variables.

     <br><dt><code>--default-chunks-in-cache</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002ddefault_002dchunks_002din_002dcache-51"></a><dd>Change the number of chunks that are accomodated in the per-variable
chunk caches that are used by default.

     <br><dt><code>--max-default-cache-size</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dmax_002ddefault_002dcache_002dsize-52"></a><dd>Change the maximum size of the per-variable chunk caches that are used
by default.

     <br><dt><code>--with-chunk-cache-size</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dwith_002dchunk_002dcache_002dsize-53"></a><dd>Change the size of the default file-level chunk cache size that will
be used when opening netCDF-4/HDF5 files.

     <br><dt><code>--with-chunk-cache-nelems</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dwith_002dchunk_002dcache_002dnelems-54"></a><dd>Change the size of the default file-level chunk cache number of
elements that will be used when opening netCDF-4/HDF5 files. Should be
a prime number.

     <br><dt><code>--with-chunk-cache-preemption</code><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dwith_002dchunk_002dcache_002dpreemption-55"></a><dd>Change the default preemption of the file-level chunk cache that will
be used when opening netCDF-4/HDF5 files. Must be a number between 0
and 1 (inclusive).

   <p>The configure script will examine your computer system &ndash; checking for
attributes that are relevant to building the netCDF package. It will
print to standard output the checks that it makes and the results that
it finds.

   <p>The configure script will also create the file "config.log", which
will contain error messages from the utilities that the configure
script uses in examining the attributes of your system. Because such
an examination can result in errors, it is expected that "config.log"
will contain error messages. Therefore, such messages do not
necessarily indicate a problem (a better indicator would be failure of
the subsequent "make"). One exception, however, is an error message in
"config.log" that indicates that a compiler could not be started. This
indicates a severe problem in your compilation environment &ndash; one that
you must fix. If this occurs, configure will not complete and will
exit with an error message telling you about the problem.

<p><a name="index-make_002c-running-56"></a><a name="index-running-make-57"></a>
Run "make". This will build one or more netCDF libraries. It will
build the basic netCDF library libnetcdf.a. If you have Fortran 77 or
Fortran 90 compilers, then the Fortran library will also be built
(libnetcdff.a). If you have a C++ compiler, then the C++ interface
will be built (libnetcdf_c++.a.)

   <p>A &ldquo;make&rdquo; will also build the netCDF utilities ncgen(1) and
ncdump(1).

Run &ldquo;make check&rdquo; to verify that the netCDF library and executables
have been built properly (you can instead run &ldquo;make test&rdquo; which does
the same thing).

   <p>A make check will build and run various test programs that test the C,
Fortran, and C++ interfaces as well as the "ncdump" and "ncgen"
utility programs.

   <p>Lines in the output beginning with "***" report on success or failure
of the tests; any failures will be reported before halting the
test. Compiler and linker warnings during the testing may be ignored.

   <p>Run the tests like this:

<pre class="example">     make check
</pre>
   <p>If you plan to use the 64-bit offset format (introduced in version
3.6.0) or the netCDF-4/HDF5 format to create very large files
(i.e. with variables larger than 2 GB), you should probably specify the
&ndash;enable-large-file-tests to configure, which tests the large file
features. You must have 13 GB of free disk space for these tests to
successfully run.

   <p>If you are running the large file tests, you may wish to use the
&ndash;with-temp-large option to specify a temporary directory for the
large files. (You may also set the environment variable TEMP_LARGE
before running configure).

   <p>The default is to create the large files in the nc_test subdirectory
of the netCDF build.

   <p>Run the large file tests like this:

<pre class="example">     ./configure --enable-large-file-tests --with-temp-large=/home/ed/tmp
     make check
</pre>
   <p>All of the large files are removed on successful completion of
tests. If the test fails, you may wish to make sure that no large
files have been left around.

   <p>If any of the the large file tests test fail, check to ensure that
your file system can handle files larger than 2 GiB by running the
following command:

<pre class="example">     	dd if=/dev/zero bs=1000000 count=3000 of=$(TEMP_LARGE)/largefile
</pre>
   <p>If your system does not have a /dev/zero, this test will fail. Then
you need to find some other way to create a file larger than 2 GiB to
ensure that your system can handle them.

To install the libraries and executables, run "make install". This
will install to the directory specified in the configure step.

   <p>Run the installation like this:

<pre class="example">     make install
</pre>
   <p>The install will put files in the following subdirectories of the
directory you provided as a prefix, creating the subdirectories if
needed:

     <dl>
<dt><code>lib</code><dd>Libraries will be installed here. If static libraries are built,
without separate fortran libraries, then libnetcdf.a and libnetcdf.la
will be installed. If the C++ API is built, libnetcdf_c++.a and
libnetcdf_c++.la will be added. If separate fortran libraries are
built, libnetcdff.a and libnetcdff.la will also be added.

     <p>Static library users should ignore the .la files, and link to the .a
files.

     <p>Shared library builds will add some .so files to this directory, as

The following platform-specific note may be helpful when building and
installing netCDF. Consult your vendor manuals for information about
the options listed here. Compilers can change from version to version;
the following information may not apply to your platform.

   <p>Full output from some of the platforms of the test platforms for
netCDF 4.1.3 can be found at <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/builds">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/builds</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">3.9.1 AIX</h4>

<p>We found the vendor compilers in /usr/vac/bin, and included this
in our PATH. Compilers were xlc, xlf, xlf90, xlC.

   <p>The F90 compiler requires the qsuffix option to believe that F90 code
files can end with .f90. This is automatically turned on by configure
when needed:

<pre class="example">         FCFLAGS=-qsuffix=f=f90
</pre>
   <p>We had to use xlf for F77 code, and xlf90 for F90 code.

   <p>To compile 64-bit code, set the appropriate environment variables
(documented below).

   <p>The environment variable OBJECT_MODE can be set to 64, or use the -q64
option on all AIX compilers by setting CFLAGS, FFLAGS, and CXXFLAGS to
-q64.

   <p>The following is also necessary on an IBM AIX SP system for 64-bit
mode:
<pre class="example">         ARFLAGS='-X64 cru'
         NMFLAGS='-X64'
</pre>
   <p>There are thread-safe versions of the AIX compilers. For example,
xlc_r is the thread-safe C compiler. To use thread-safe compilers,
override the configure script by setting CC to xlc_r; similarly for FC
and CXX.

   <p>For large file support, AIX requires that the macro _LARGE_FILES be
defined. The configure script does this using
AC_SYS_LARGEFILES. Unfortunately, this misfires when OBJECT_MODE is
64, or the q64 option is used. The netCDF tries to fix this by turning
on _LARGE_FILES anyway in these cases.

   <p>The GNU C compiler does not mix successfully with the AIX fortran
compilers.

<h4 class="subsection">3.9.2 Cygwin</h4>

<p>NetCDF builds under Cygwin tools on Windows just as with Linux.

<h4 class="subsection">3.9.3 HPUX</h4>

<p>The HP Fortran compiler (f77, a.k.a. fort77, also f90) requires FLIBS
to include -lU77 for the fortran tests to work. The configure script
does this automatically.

   <p>For the c89 compiler to work, CPPFLAGS must include
-D_HPUX_SOURCE. This isn't required for the cc compiler. The configure
script adds this as necessary.

   <p>For large file support, HP-UX requires _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64. The
configure script sets this automatically.

   <p>The HPUX C++ compiler doesn't work on netCDF code. It's too old for
that. So either use GNU to compile netCDF, or skip the C++ code by
setting CXX to &rdquo; (in csh: setenv CXX &rdquo;).

   <p>Building a 64 bit version may be possible with the following settings:
<pre class="example">         CC=/bin/cc
         CPPFLAGS='-D_HPUX_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64'    # large file support
         CFLAGS='-g +DD64'                           # 64-bit mode
         FC=/opt/fortran90/bin/f90                   # Fortran-90 compiler
         FFLAGS='-w +noppu +DA2.0W'                  # 64-bit mode, no "_" suffixes
         FLIBS=-lU77
         CXX=''                                      # no 64-bit mode C++ compiler
</pre>
   <p>Sometimes quotas or configuration causes HPUX disks to be limited to 2
GiB files. In this cases, netCDF cannot create very large
files. Rather confusingly, HPUX returns a system error that indicates
that a value is too large to be stored in a type. This may cause
scientists to earnestly check for attempts to write floats or doubles
that are too large. In fact, the problem seems to be an internal
integer problem, when the netCDF library attempts to read beyond the 2
GiB boundary. To add to the confusion, the boundary for netCDF is
slightly less than 2 GiB, since netCDF uses buffered I/O to improve
performance.

<h4 class="subsection">3.9.4 Irix</h4>

<p>A 64-bit version can be built by setting the appropriate environment
variables.

   <p>Build 64-bit by setting CFLAGS, FFLAGS, and CXXFLAGS to -64.

   <p>On our machine, there is a /bin/cc and a /usr/bin/cc, and the -64
option only works with the former.

<h4 class="subsection">3.9.5 Linux</h4>

<p>The gFortran flag is required with GNU fortran:
<pre class="example">         CPPFLAGS=-DgFortran
</pre>
   <p>For Portland Group Fortran, set pgiFortran instead:
<pre class="example">         CPPFLAGS=-DpgiFortran
</pre>
   <p>Portland Group F90/F95 does not mix with GNU g77.

   <p>The netCDF configure script should notice which fortran compiler is
being used, and set these automatically.

   <p>For large file support, _FILE_OFFSET_BITS must be set to 64. The
netCDF configure script should set this automatically.

<h4 class="subsection">3.9.6 Macintosh</h4>

<p>The gFortran flag is required with GNU fortran
(CPPFLAGS=-DgFortran). The NetCDF configure script should and set
this automatically.

   <p>For IBM compilers on the Mac, the following may work (we lack this
test environment):
<pre class="example">         CC=/usr/bin/cc
         CPPFLAGS=-DIBMR2Fortran
         F77=xlf
         FC=xlf90
         FCFLAGS=-qsuffix=cpp=f90
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">3.9.7 OSF1</h4>

<p>NetCDF builds out of the box on OSF1.

<h4 class="subsection">3.9.8 SunOS</h4>

<p>PATH should contain /usr/ccs/bin to find make, nm, ar, etc.

   <p>For large file support, _FILE_OFFSET_BITS must be 64, also
_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE and _LARGEFILE_SOURCE must be set. Configure will
turn this on automatically for netCDF, but not for HDF5. So when
building HDF5, set these variables before running configure, or HDF5
will not be capable of producing large files.

   <p>To compile in 64-bit mode, set -m64 (formerly -xarch=v9, which works
on SPARC platforms only) on all compilers (i.e. in CFLAGS, FFLAGS,
FCFLAGS, and CXXFLAGS).

   <p>When compiling with GNU Fortran (g77), the -DgFortran flag is
required for the Fortran interface to work. The NetCDF configure
script turns this on automatically if needed.

<h4 class="subsection">3.9.9 Handling Fortran Compilers</h4>

<p>Commercial fortran compilers will generally require at least one flag
in the CPPFLAGS variable. The netCDF configure script tries to set
this for you, but won't try if you have used &ndash;disable-flag-setting,
or if you have already set CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FCFLAGS, or
FFLAGS yourself.

   <p>The first thing to try is to set nothing and see if the netCDF
configure script finds your fortran compiler, and sets the correct
flags automatically.

   <p>If it doesn't find the correct fortran compiler, you can next try
setting the FC environment variable to the compiler you wish to use,
and then see if the configure script can set the correct flags for
that compiler.

   <p>If all that fails, you must set the flags yourself.

   <p>The Intel compiler likes the pgiFortran flag, as does the Portland
Group compiler. (Automatically turned on if your fortran compiler is
named &ldquo;ifort&rdquo; or &ldquo;pgf90&rdquo;).

   <p>Alternatively, Intel has provided a web page on &ldquo;Building netCDF with
the Intel compilers&rdquo; at
<a href="http://www.intel.com/support/performancetools/sb/CS-027812.htm">http://www.intel.com/support/performancetools/sb/CS-027812.htm</a>,
providing instructions for building netCDF (without using the
pgiFortran flag).

   <p>The Portland Group also has a &ldquo;PGI Guide to NetCDF&rdquo; at
<a href="http://www.pgroup.com/resources/netcdf/netcdf362_pgi71.htm">http://www.pgroup.com/resources/netcdf/netcdf362_pgi71.htm</a>.

The configure and build system should work on any system which has a
modern "sh" shell, "make", and so on. The configure and build system
is less portable than the "C" code itself, however. You may run into
problems with the "include" syntax in the Makefiles. You can use GNU
make to overcome this, or simply manually include the specified files
after running configure.

   <p>Instruction for building netCDF on other platforms can be found at
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/other-builds.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/other-builds.html</a>. If you build netCDF on a new
platform, please send your environment variables and any other
important notes to support-netcdf@unidata.ucar.edu and we will add the
information to the other builds page, with a credit to you.

   <p>If you can't run the configure script, you will need to create
config.h and fortran/nfconfig.inc. Start with ncconfig.in and
fortran/nfconfig.in and set the defines as appropriate for your
system.

   <p>Operating system dependency is isolated in the "ncio" module. We
provide two versions. posixio.c uses POSIX system calls like "open()",
"read()" and "write().  ffio.c uses a special library available on
CRAY systems. You could create other versions for different operating
systems. The program "t_ncio.c" can be used as a simple test of this
layer.

   <p>Note that we have not had a Cray to test on for some time. In
particular, large file support is not tested with ffio.c.

   <p>Numerical representation dependency is isolated in the "ncx"
module. As supplied, ncx.m4 (ncx.c) supports IEEE floating point
representation, VAX floating point, and CRAY floating
point. BIG_ENDIAN vs LITTLE_ENDIAN is handled, as well as various
sizes of "int", "short", and "long". We assume, however, that a "char"
is eight bits.

   <p>There is a separate implementation of the ncx interface available as
ncx_cray.c which contains optimizations for CRAY vector
architectures. Move the generic ncx.c out of the way and rename
ncx_cray.c to ncx.c to use this module. By default, this module does
not use the IEG2CRAY and CRAY2IEG library calls. When compiled with
aggressive in-lining and optimization, it provides equivalent
functionality with comparable speed and clearer error semantics. If
you wish to use the IEG library functions, compile this module with
-DUSE_IEG.

<h3 class="section">3.11 Contributing to NetCDF Source Code Development</h3>

<p>Most users will not be interested in working directly with the netCDF
source code. Rather, they will write programs which call netCDF
functions, and delve no further. However some intrepid users may wish
to dig into the netCDF code to study it, to try and spot bugs, or to
make modifications for their own purposes.

   <p>To work with the netCDF source code, several extra utilities are
required to fully build everything from source. If you are going to
modify the netCDF source code, you will need some or all of the
following Unix tools.

     <dl>
<dt><code>m4</code><a name="index-m4-96"></a><dd>Macro processing language used heavily in libsrc, nc_test. Generates
(in these cases) C code from m4 source. Version 1.4 works fine with
release 3.5.1 through 3.6.2.

     <br><dt><code>flex and yacc</code><a name="index-flex-and-yacc-97"></a><dd>Used in ncgen directory to parse CDL files. Generates C files from .y
and .l files. You only need to use this to modify ncgen's understanding of
CDL grammar.

     <br><dt><code>makeinfo</code><a name="index-makeinfo-98"></a><dd>Generates all documentation formats (except man pages) from texinfo
source. I'm using makeinfo version 4.8, as of release 3.6.2. If you
have trouble with makeinfo, upgrade to this version and try again. You
only need makeinfo if you want to modify the documentation.

     <br><dt><code>tex</code><a name="index-tex-99"></a><dd>Knuth's venerable typesetting system. The version I am running (for
netCDF release 3.6.2) is TeX 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4). I have found that
some recent installations of TeX will not build the netCDF
documentation - it's not clear to me why.

     <p>The user generally will just want to download the latest version of
netCDF documents at the netCDF website. <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/docs">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/docs</a>.

     <br><dt><code>autoconf</code><a name="index-autoconf-100"></a><dd>Generates the configure script. Version 2.59 or later is required.

     <br><dt><code>automake</code><a name="index-automake-101"></a><dd>Since version 3.6.2 of netCDF, automake is used to generate the
Makefile.in files needed by the configure script to build the
Makefiles.

     <br><dt><code>libtool</code><a name="index-libtool-102"></a><dd>Since version 3.6.2 of netCDF, libtool is used to help generate shared
libraries platforms which support them. Version 2.1a of libtool is
required.

     <br><dt><code>sed</code><a name="index-sed-103"></a><dd>This text processing tool is used to process some of the netCDF
examples before they are included in the tutorial. This is only needed
to build the documentation, which the user generally will not need to
do.

   </dl>

   <p>NetCDF has a large and enterprising user community, and a long history
of accepting user modifications into the netCDF code base. Examples
include the 64-bit offset format, and the F90 API.

   <p>All suggested changes and additions to netCDF code can be sent to
support-netcdf@unidata.ucar.edu.

<p><a name="index-link-options-104"></a><a name="index-compiler-flags-105"></a><a name="index-nc_002dconfig-106"></a>
To use netCDF you must link to the netCDF library, and, if using the
netCDF-4/HDF5 features, also two HDF5, at least one compression
library, and (on some systems) the math library.

<h3 class="section">4.1 Using Linker Flags with NetCDF</h3>

<p>For this to work, you have to tell the linker which libraries to link
to (with the -l option), and where to find them (with the -L option).

   <p>Use the -L option to your linker to pass the directories in which
netCDF, HDF5, and zlib are installed.

   <p>Use the -l (lower-case L) option to list the libraries, which must be
listed in the correct order:

<pre class="example">     -lnetcdf -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lz -lm
</pre>
   <p>If szip was used when building HDF5, you must also use -lsz.

   <p>On some systems you must also include -lm for the math library.

   <p>If HDF4 was used when building netCDF, you must also use -lmfhdf -ldf
-ljpeg.

   <p>Finally, if you use the parallel-netcdf library, you must use
-lpnetcdf.

   <p>The worst case scenario is, using all of the above libraries:

<pre class="example">     -lnetcdf -lpnetcdf -lmfhdf -ldf -ljpeg -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lz -lsz -lm
</pre>
   <p>In such a case one also needs to provide the locations of the
libraries, with the -L flag. If libraries are installed in the same
directory, this is easier.

   <p>Use the nc-config to learn the exact flags needed on your system
(see <a href="#nc_002dconfig">nc-config</a>).

<h3 class="section">4.2 Using Compiler Flags with NetCDF</h3>

<p>Depending on how netCDF was built, you may need to use compiler flags
when building your code. For example, many systems build both 32-bit
and 64-bit binaries. The GNU C compiler, for example, uses -m32 and
-m64 as compiler flags for this purpose.

   <p>If netCDF is built with the default compiler flags (i.e. no special
flags are used), then no flags need to be used by the user.

   <p>If netCDF is built using flags that control architecture or other
important aspects of the binary output, then those flags may need to
be set by all users as well.

<h3 class="section">4.3 Using the nc-config Utility to Find Compiler and Linker Flags</h3>

<p>To assist with the setting of compiler and linker flags, the nc-config
utility is provided with netCDF. The nc-config utility is a very
simple script which contains the settings of the C and Fortran flags
used during the netCDF build.

   <p>For example, the nc-config command can be used to get the command line
options needed to link a C program to netCDF:

<pre class="example">     nc-config --libs
     -L/usr/local/lib -lnetcdf -L/shecky/local_post/lib -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lz
</pre>
   <p>The nc-config utility can also be used to learn about the features of
the current netCDF installation. For example, it can show whether
netCDF-4 is available:

<pre class="example">     ./nc-config --has-nc4
     yes
</pre>
   <p>Use the &ndash;help option to nc-config for a full list of available
information.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Building and Installing NetCDF on Windows</h2>

<p><a name="index-windows_002c-building-on-107"></a><a name="index-VC_002b_002b-108"></a><a name="index-NET-109"></a><a name="index-DLL-110"></a><a name="index-Microsoft-111"></a>
NetCDF can be built and used from a variety of development
environments on Windows. The netCDF library is implemented as a
Windows dynamic link library (DLL). The simplest way to get started
with netCDF under Windows is to download the pre-built DLL from the
Unidata web site.

   <p>Building under the Cygwin port of GNU tools is treated as a Unix
install. See <a href="#Platform-Notes">Platform Notes</a>.

   <p>Instructions are also given for building the netCDF DLL from the
source code.

   <p>VC++ documentation being so voluminous, finding the right information
can be a chore. There's a good discussion of using DLLs called &ldquo;About
Dynamic-Link Libraries&rdquo; at (perhaps)
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/dynamic_link_libraries.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/dynamic_link_libraries.asp</a>.

   <p>From the .NET point of view, the netCDF dll is unmanaged code. As a
starting point, see the help topic &ldquo;Consuming Unmanaged DLL
Functions&rdquo; which may be found at
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconConsumingUnmanagedDLLFunctions.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconConsumingUnmanagedDLLFunctions.asp</a>,

<p><a name="index-binaries_002c-windows-112"></a><a name="index-dll_002c-getting-113"></a>
We have pre-built Win32 binary versions of the netcdf dll and static

Whether you get the pre-built DLL or build your own, you'll then have
to install it somewhere so that your other programs can find it and
use it.

   <p>To install a DLL, you just have to leave it in some directory, and
(possibly) tell your compiler in which directory to look for it.

   <p>A DLL is a library, and functions just like libraries under the Unix
operating system. As with any library, the point of the netCDF DLL is
to provide functions that you can call from your own code. When you
compile that code, the linker needs to be able to find the library,
and then it pulls out the functions that it needs. In the Unix world,
the -L option tells the compiler where to look for a library. In
Windows, library search directories can be added to the project's
property dialog.

   <p>Similarly, you will need to put the header file, netcdf.h, somewhere
that you compiler can find it. In the Unix world, the -I option tells
the compiler to look in a certain directory to find header files. In
the Windows world, you set this in the project properties dialog box
of your integrated development environment.

   <p>Therefore, installing the library means nothing more than copying the
DLL somewhere that your compiler can find it, and telling the compiler
where to look for them.

   <p>The standard place to put DLLs is Windows\System32 folder (for
Windows2000/XP) or the Windows\System folder (for Windows 98/ME). If
you put the DLL there, along with the ncgen and ncdump executables,
you will be able to use the DLL and utilities without further work,
because compilers already look there for DLLs and EXEs.

   <p>Instead of putting the DLL and EXEs into the system directory, you can
leave them wherever you want, and every development project that uses
the dll will have to be told to search the netCDF directory when it's
linking, or, the chosen directory can be added to your path.

   <p>On the .NET platform, you can also try to use the global assembly
cache. (To learn how, see MSDN topic &ldquo;Global Assembly Cache&rdquo;, at
<a href="www.msdn.microsoft.com">www.msdn.microsoft.com</a>).

   <p>Following Windows conventions, the netCDF files belong in the
following places:

<h3 class="section">5.3 Building netcdf.dll with VC++ 6.0</h3>

<p><a name="index-VC_002b_002b-6_002e0_002c-building-with-118"></a>
The most recent releases of netCDF aren't tested under VC++ 6.0. (They
are tested with VC++.NET). Older versions of the library, notably
3.5.0, did compile with VC++ 6.0, and the instructions for doing so
are presented below.

   <p>Note that the introduction of better large file support (for files
larger than 2 GiB) in version 3.6.0 and greater requires an off_t type
of 8 bytes, and it's not clear how, or if, this can be found in VC++
6.0.

   <p>To build the library yourself, get the file
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/contrib/win32/netcdf-3.5.0.win32make.VC6.zip

   <p>The makefiles there describe how to build netcdf-3.5
using the using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.x and (optionally)
Digital Visual Fortran 6.x. Because of difficulties in getting
Microsoft Visual Studio to fall in line with our existing
source directory scheme, we chose _not_ to build the system
"inside" Visual Studio. Instead, we provide a simple group
of "msoft.mak" files which can be used. If you
wish to work in Visual Studio, go ahead. Read the
section called "Macros" at the end of this discussion.

   <p>As of this writing, we have not tried compiling the
C++ interface in this environment.

   <p>nmake is a Microsoft version of make, which comes with VC 6.0 (and VC
7.0) in directory C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin
(or, for VC 7.0, C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
2003\Vc7\bin).

   <p>To build netcdf, proceed as follows:

     <dl>
<dt><code>unpack source distribution.</code>
<br><dt><code>copy netcdf-3.5.0.win32make.VC6.zip</code><dd>copy netcdf-3.5.0.win32make.VC6.zip into the netcdf-3.5.0/src
directory, and unzip it from there.

     <br><dt><code>cd src\libsrc; nmake /f msoft.mak</code><dd>Run this command in src\libsrc. This will build netcdf.lib and
netcdf.dll Note: This makefiles make DLLs. To make static libraries
see section on static libraries.

     <br><dt><code>nmake /f msoft.mak test</code><dd>Optionally, in src\libsrc, make and run the simple test.

     <br><dt><code>cd ..\fortran; nmake /f msoft.mak</code><dd>Optionally build the fortran interface and rebuild dll in ..\libsrc to
include the fortran interface. Note Bene: We don't provide a .DEF
file, so this step changes the "ordinals" by which entry points in the
DLL found. Some sites may wish to modify the msoft.mak file(s) to
produce a separate library for the fortran interface.

     <br><dt><code>nmake /f msoft.mak test</code><dd>(necessary if you want to use fortran code) While you are in
src\fortran; nmake /f msoft.mak test This tests the netcdf-2 fortran
interface.

     <br><dt><code>cd ..\nctest; nmake /f msoft.mak test</code><dd>(optional, but recommended) In src\nctest; nmake /f msoft.mak test
This tests the netcdf-2 C interface.

     <br><dt><code>cd ..\nc_test; nmake /f msoft.mak test</code><dd>(optional, but highly recommended) In src\nc_test; nmake /f msoft.mak
test This tortures the netcdf-3 C interface.

     <br><dt><code>cd ..\nf_test; nmake /f msoft.mak test</code><dd>(optional, but highly recommended if you built the fortran interface)
In src\nf_test; nmake /f msoft.mak test This tortures the netcdf-3
fortran interface.

     <br><dt><code>..\ncdump; nmake /f msoft.mak</code><dd>In src\ncdump; nmake /f msoft.mak This makes ncdump.exe.

     <br><dt><code>..\ncgen; nmake /f msoft.mak</code><dd>In src\ncgen; nmake /f msoft.mak This makes ncgen.exe.

     <br><dt><code>..\ncdump; nmake /f msoft.mak test</code><dd>(optional) In src\ncdump; nmake /f msoft.mak test This tests
ncdump. Both ncgen and ncdump need to be built prior to this
test. Note the makefile sets the path so that ..\libsrc\netcdf.dll can
be located.

     <br><dt><code>..\ncgen; nmake /f msoft.mak test</code><dd>(optional) In src\ncgen; nmake /f msoft.mak test This tests
ncgen. Both ncgen and ncdump need to be built prior to this test. Note
the makefile sets the path so that ..\libsrc\netcdf.dll can be
located.

     <br><dt><code>To Install</code><dd>Copy libsrc\netcdf.lib to a LIBRARY directory. 
Copy libsrc\netcdf.h and fortran/netcdf.inc to an INCLUDE directory. 
Copy libsrc\netcdf.dll, ncdump/ncdump.exe, and ncgen/ncgen.exe to
a BIN directory (someplace in your PATH).

To build the netCDF dll with VC++.NET open the win32/NET/netcdf.sln
file with Visual Studio. Both Debug and Release configurations are
available - select one and build.

   <p>The resulting netcdf.dll file will be in subdirectory Release or
Debug.

   <p>The netCDF tests will be built and run as part of the build
process. The Fortran 77 interface will be built, but not the Fortran
90 or C++ interfaces.

   <p>Unfortunately, different fortran compilers require different flag
settings in the netCDF configuration files. (In UNIX builds, this is
handled by the configure script.)

   <p>The quick_large_files test program is provided as an extra project,
however it is not run during the build process, but can be run from
the command line or the IDE. Note that, despite its name, it is not
quick. On Unix systems, this program runs in a few seconds, because of
some features of the Unix file system apparently not present in
Windows. Nonetheless, the program does run, and creates (then deletes)
some very large files. (So make sure you have at least 15 GiB of space
available). It takes about 45 minutes to run this program on our
Windows machines, so please be patient.

Load-time linking to the DLL is the most straightforward from
C++. This means the netcdf.lib file has to end up on the compile
command line. This being Windows, that's hidden by a GUI.

   <p>In Visual Studio 2003 this can be done by modifying three of the
project's properties.

   <p>Open the project properties window from the project menu. Go to the
linker folder and look at the general properties. Modify the property
&ldquo;Additional Library Directories&rdquo; by adding the directory which
contains the netcdf.dll and netcdf.lib files.  Now go to the linker
input properties and set the property &ldquo;Additional Dependencies&rdquo; to
netcdf.lib.

   <p>Finally, still within the project properties window, go to the C/C++
folder, and look at the general properties. Modify &ldquo;Additional
Include Directories&rdquo; to add the directory with the netcdf.h file.

   <p>Now use the netCDF functions in your C++ code. Of course any C or C++
file that wants to use the functions will need:

<pre class="example">     #include &lt;netcdf.h&gt;

<h3 class="section">6.1 The Usual Build Problems</h3>

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.1 Taking the Easy Way Out</h4>

<p>Why not take the easy way out if you can?

   <p>Many Linux systems contain package management programs which allow
netCDF to be installed easily. This is the prefered installation
method for netCDF.

   <p>Precompiled binaries for some platforms can be found at
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp</a>. Click on your platform, and copy
the files from the bin, include, lib, and man directories into your
own local equivalents (Perhaps /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/include,
etc.).

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.2 How to Clean Up the Mess from a Failed Build</h4>

<p>If you are trying to get the configure or build to work, make sure you
start with a clean distribution for each attempt. If netCDF failed in
the &ldquo;make&rdquo; you must clean up the mess before trying again. To clean
up the distribution:

<pre class="example">     make distclean
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">6.1.3 Platforms On Which NetCDF is Known to Work</h4>

<p>At NetCDF World Headquarters (in sunny Boulder, Colorado), as part of
the wonderful Unidata organization, we have a wide variety of
computers, operating systems, and compilers. At night, house elves
test netCDF on all these systems.

   <p>Output for the netCDF test platforms can be found at
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/builds">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/builds</a>.

   <p>Compare the output of your build attempt with ours. Are you using the
same compiler? The same flags? Look for the configure output that
lists the settings of CC, FC, CXX, CFLAGS, etc.

   <p>On some systems you have to set environment variables to get the
configure and build to work.

   <p>For example, for a 64-bit IRIX install of the netCDF-3.6.2 release,
the variables are set before netCDF is configured or built. In this
case we set CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FCFLAGS, and FFLAGS.

<pre class="example">     flip% uname -a
     IRIX64 flip 6.5 07080050 IP30 mips
     flip% setenv CFLAGS -64
     flip% setenv CXXFLAGS -64
     flip% setenv FFLAGS -64
     flip% setenv FCFLAGS -64
     flip% make distclean;./configure;make check
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">6.1.4 Platforms On Which NetCDF is Reported to Work</h4>

<p>If your platform isn't listed on the successful build page, see if
another friendly netCDF user has sent in values for environment
variables that are reported to work:
(<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/other-builds.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/other-builds.html</a>).

   <p>If you build on a system that we don't have at Unidata (particularly
if it's something interesting and exotic), please send us the settings
that work (and the entire build output would be nice too). Send them
to support-netcdf@unidata.ucar.edu.

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.5 If You Have a Broken Compiler</h4>

<p>For netCDF to build correctly, you must be able to compile C from your
environment, and, optionally, Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and C++. If
C doesn't work, netCDF can't compile.

   <p>What breaks a C compiler? Installation or upgrade mistakes when the C
compiler was installed, or multiple versions or compilers installed on
top of each other. Commercial compilers frequently require some
environment variables to be set, and some directories to appear ahead
of others in your path. Finally, if you have an expired or broken
license, your C compiler won't work.

   <p>If you have a broken C compiler and a working C compiler in your PATH,
netCDF might only find the broken one. You can fix this by explicitly
setting the CC environmental variable to a working C compiler, and
then trying to build netCDF again. (Don't forget to do a &ldquo;make
distclean&rdquo; first!)

   <p>If you can't build a C program, you can't build netCDF. Sorry, but
that's just the way it goes. (You can get the GNU C compiler - search
the web for &ldquo;gcc&rdquo;).

   <p>If netCDF finds a broken Fortran 90, Fortran 77, or C++ compiler, it
will report the problem during the configure, and then drop the
associated API. For example, if the C++ compiler can't compile a very
simple test program, it will drop the C++ interface. If you really
want the C++ API, set the CXX environment variable to a working C++
compiler.

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.6 What to Do If NetCDF Still Won't Build</h4>

<p>If none of the above help, try our troubleshooting section:
See <a href="#Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>.

   <p>Also check to see of your problem has already been solved by someone
else (see <a href="#Finding-Help">Finding Help</a>).

   <p>If you still can't get netCDF to build, report your problem to
Unidata, but please make sure you submit all the information we need
to help (see <a href="#Reporting-Problems">Reporting Problems</a>).

<h3 class="section">6.2 Troubleshooting</h3>

<p><a name="index-troubleshooting-130"></a><a name="index-turning-off-C_002b_002b_002c-Fortran-interface-131"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.1 Problems During Configuration</h4>

<p>If the ./configure; make check fails, it's a good idea to turn off the
C++ and Fortran interfaces, and try to build the C interface
alone. All other interfaces depend on the C interface, so nothing else
will work until the C interface works. To turn off C++ and Fortran,
set environment variables CXX and FC to NULL before running the netCDF
configure script (with csh: setenv FC &rdquo;;setenv CXX &rdquo;).

   <p>Turning off the Fortran and C++ interfaces results in a much shorter
build and test cycle, which is useful for debugging problems.

   <p>If the netCDF configure fails, most likely the problem is with your
development environment. The configure script looks through your path to
find all the tools it needs to build netCDF, including C compiler and
linker, the ar, ranlib, and others. The configure script will tell
you what tools it found, and where they are on your system. Here's
part of configure's output on a Linux machine:

<pre class="example">     checking CPPFLAGS...
     checking CC CFLAGS... cc -g -O2
     checking type cc... cc is /usr/bin/cc
     checking CXX... c++
     checking CXXFLAGS... -g -O2
     checking type c++... c++ is /usr/bin/c++
     checking FC... gfortran
     checking FFLAGS... -g -O2
     checking type gfortran... gfortran is /usr/bin/gfortran
     checking F90... gfortran
     checking FCFLAGS... -g -O2
     checking type gfortran... gfortran is /usr/bin/gfortran
     checking AR... ar
     checking AR_FLAGS... cru
     checking type ar... ar is /usr/bin/ar
     checking NM... /usr/bin/nm -B
     checking NMFLAGS...
     checking for /usr/bin/nm... /usr/bin/nm -B
     checking nm flags...
</pre>
   <p>Make sure that the tools, directories, and flags are set to reasonable
values, and compatible tools. For example the GNU tools may not
inter-operate well with vendor tools. If you're using a vendor
compiler, you may need to use the ar, nm, and ranlib that the vendor
supplied.

   <p>As configure runs, it creates a config.log file. If configure crashes,
do a text search of config.log for thing it was checking before
crashing. If you have a licensing or tool compatibility problem, it
will be obvious in config.log.

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.2 Problems During Compilation</h4>

<p>If the configure script runs, but the compile step doesn't work, or
the tests don't complete successfully, the problem is probably in your
CFLAGS or CPPFLAGS.

   <p>Frequently shared libraries are a rich source of problems. If your
build is not working, and you are using the &ndash;enable-shared option to
generate shared libraries, then try to build without &ndash;enable-shared,
and see if the static library build works.

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.3 Problems During Testing</h4>

<p>If you are planning on using large files (i.e. &gt; 2 GiB), then you may
wish to rerun configure with &ndash;enable-large-file-tests to ensure that
large files work on your system.

   <p>Some DAP tests (in the directory ncdap_test) attempt to access an
external server at opendap.org.  It is possible that the DAP server
may not be running at test time, or the network access may be
faulty or that the output of the test server has changed. 
In this case, the DAP tests may fail. Because of this,
the use of these tests is controlled by the &ndash;enable-dap-remote-tests
option.

   <p>Reportedly successful settings for platforms unavailable for netCDF
testing can be found at <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/other-builds.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/other-builds.html</a>. If you
build netCDF on a system that is not listed, please send your
environment settings, and the full output of your configure, compile,
and testing, to support-netcdf@unidata.ucar.edu. We will add the
information to the other-builds page, with a credit to you.

   <p>The replies to all netCDF support emails are on-line and can be
searched. Before reporting a problem to Unidata, please search this
on-line database to see if your problem has already been addressed in
a support email. If you are having build problems it's usually useful
to search on your system host name. On Unix systems, use the uname
command to find it.

To help us solve your problem, please include the following
information in your email to <a href="support-netcdf@unidata.ucar.edu">support-netcdf@unidata.ucar.edu</a>.

   <p>Unfortunately, we can't solve build questions without this
information; if you ask for help without providing it, we're just
going to have to ask for it.

   <p>So why not send it immediately, and save us both the extra trouble?

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>the exact version of netCDF - see the VERSION file.

     <li>the *complete* output of &ldquo;./configure&rdquo;, &ldquo;make&rdquo;, and &ldquo;make check. Yes,
it's long, but it's all important.

     <li>if the configure failed, the contents of config.log.

     <li>if you are having problems with very large files (larger than
2GiB), send the output of "make check" after first running "make
distclean" and invoking the configure script with the
&ndash;enable-large-file-tests option included.

        </ol>

   <p>Although responses to your email will be available in our support
database, your email address is not included, to provide spammers with
one less place to harvest it from.
