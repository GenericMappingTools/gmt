2.1.21  2010-01-24
        Eliminate expectation and use of leading scale factor in the "have"
        unit of udunits2(1).

        Add verification of commit status to "make ftp".

        Add dependency of documentation on version.

        Add "force" flag to tagging rule in makefile.

2.1.20  2010-12-20
        Added "fahrenheit" as an alias for "degrees fahrenheit".

        Added hyperlinks from HTML documentation to XML files of the units
        database.

2.1.19  2010-08-17
        Moved ut_set_error_message_handler(ut_ignore) call in version 2.1.18
        to eliminate more messages.

2.1.18  2010-08-13
        Made the UDUNIT-1 function utInit() call 
        ut_set_error_message_handler(ut_ignore) to make use of the UDUNITS-1
        API more backward compatible.

2.1.17  2010-06-23
        Added tagging of version in repository to "make ftp".

        Moved call to ut_set_second() in XML parser from after the XML file is
        read to as soon as the "second" unit is encountered.

2.1.16  2010-06-21
        Corrected and updated definition of "e" -- the charge of an electron.

2.1.15  2010-05-27
        Corrected return value of ut_get_status() when ut_parse() fails due to
        a syntax error.

        Added missing "void" parameter to declarations of UDUNITS-1 functions
        utIsInit() and utTerm().

        Added commentary about the hybrid Gregorian/Julian calendar to the
        library documentation.

        Added the following units:
            "potential_vorticity_unit" (1e-6 m2 s-1 K kg-1)
            "einstein" (mole)

        Added "u" as a symbol for "micro".

2.1.14  2010-01-29
        Modified the build procedure.  It now
            1) Builds the Expat (XML parsing) library that's bundled with the
               UDUNITS-2 package if and only if the host system doesn't have
               one; and
            2) Installs the bundled Expat library if that library is built.

        Documented the need for linking against an Expat library.

2.1.13  2010-01-21
        Modified the build procedure slightly.  It now
            1) Supports cross-compilation; and
            2) Installs the info(1) documentation files by default.

2.1.12  2010-01-11
        Corrected initialization of time-origin to prevent inconsistent results
        from ut_decode_time().  Thanks to David Pierce at the Scripps
        Institution of Oceanography.

2.1.11	2009-10-23
	Added missing percent (%) unit.

2.1.10	2009-10-21
	Fixed memory-related problems reported by valgrind(1).

        Changed $(pkgdatarootdir) to $(pkgdatadir) in the top-level Makefile.

	Corrected the syntax in the definition of the US survey foot.

2.1.9	2009-09-09
        Fixed bug in ut_are_convertible() that caused it to return true for
        m2.s-2 and m.s-2.

        Changed installation directory for units database files from $(datadir)
        (default: /usr/local/share) to $(pkgdatadir) (default:
        /usr/local/share/udunits).

        Changed name of "ut_unit*" member in the UDUNITS-1 "utUnit"
        backward-compatibility structure from "ut_unit" to "unit2" because,
        unlike C, the g++ compiler doesn't allow a member to have the same name
        as a typedef.

        Added version specification to the top-level UDUNITS-2 documentation.

2.1.8	2009-06-19
	Corrected definition of "lbf": was "2000 force_pounds"; is now
	"1 force_pound".

2.1.7	2009-05-05
	Replaced angle brackets with quotation marks in inclusion of the
	UDUNITS-2 header-file by the UDUNITS-1 header-file.  This was
	done to accomodate ncview's configure-script and because it's
	the right thing to do because both header-files are installed in the
	same directory.

	Added test for math library to configure script to support
	systems whose C library doesn't have them.

	Improved the process for making the "results.tab" target in the
	test/ subdirectory.

	Added delays to process for creating documentation source to
	accomodate broken HP-UX B.11.00 make(1).

	Added "make check" to git pre-commit hook.

2.1.6	2009-04-15
	Added to the installed, top-level, UDUNITS-2 documentation,
	commentary about the existence of a version 1 C API in the
	package.

	Moved the UDUNITS-1 API into the UDUNITS-2 library subdirectory,
	"lib", in order to allow "make check" to build the package.

2.1.5	2009-03-24
	Fixed bug in udunits2(1) utility introduced in version 2.1.2.
	Entering a "have" unit that didn't have a numerical first
	component risked a segmentation violation.

2.1.4	2009-03-24
	Documented the change in meaning of the symbol "g" from the
	original package (standard free fall) to this package (gram).

	Returned HP-UX to the set of tested operating systems.

2.1.3	2009-03-23
	Corrected typos in XML units database for "US_survey_foot" and
	"international_foot": removed embedded quotation marks.

2.1.2	2009-03-19
	Corrected program udunits2(1): it now correctly parses units
	like "0.1 lg(re 1.0e-12 W.m-2)".

	Made the dimensionless unit one format as "1".

	Corrected rule for target "web-update": changed "distname" to
	"distName".

	Corrected the development make(1) target "hostcheck": added
	setting of MAKEFLAGS to the empty string before invoking
	make(1).

2.1.1	2009-03-13
	Corrected and improved the development make(1) targets "ftp"
	and "download-update".

	Added publication of the XML database on the UDUNITS website to
	the target "web-update".

	Corrected typo in API documentation.

2.1.0	2009-03-11
	Added UDUNITS-1 API.  This thin interface uses the UDUNITS-2
	library.  Users will have to recompile their UDUNITS-1-based 
	code using the new "udunits.h" header-file and rebuild their
	programs using the new UDUNITS-2 library.  Because the UDUNITS-1
	API uses the "utUnit" data-structure and the UDUNITS-2 API uses
	pointers to "ut_unit" data-structures, a small memory-leak is 
	possible in code that creates many units.  This leak can be 
	avoided by calling the new method utFree(utUnit*) when the unit
	is no longer needed.

	Added some "const" qualifiers to the API.

	Modified ut_format() for timestamp units.  It now prints the
	long form (with hyphens and colons) if the year of the origin is
	less than 1000 or greater than 9999.  This was done to make
	ut_format() compatible with ut_parse().

2.0.4	2009-02-21
	Added copyright notices and LICENSE file.

2.0.3	2009-02-18
        Added the function ut_root(const ut_unit* unit, int root) to
        return a root of a unit (e.g., "m2/s2" -> "m/s").

2.0.2	2008-12-02
	Changed order of calls to ut_set_status() and
	ut_handle_error_message() so that the status value is always set
	before the error-message handler is called.  This allows error
	handlers to determine the cause of the message.

2.0.1	2008-11-13
	Added parsing of timestamps that have dashes and colons but also
	use "T" (e.g., "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z").

	Corrected the regular expressions for matching the character-set
	specifier in the udunits2(1) program.

2.0.0	2007-07-18
	Initial release.
