1 Introduction
**************

The UDUNITS-2 package provides support for units of physical quantities.
Its three main components are: 1) *note a C library: (udunits2lib)Top.
for units of physical quantities; 2) *note a utility:
(udunits2prog)Top.; for obtaining the definition of a unit and for
converting numeric values between compatible units; and 3) an extensive
database of units.

2 How This Package Differs from the Original `UDUNITS' Package
**************************************************************

The `UDUNIT-2' package differs from the original `UDUNITS' package in
the following ways:
   * *Support for non-ASCII characters:* The original `UDUNITS' package
     only supports the ASCII character set.  The `UDUNITS-2' package
     supports the following character sets: ASCII, ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1),
     and the UTF-8 encoding of ISO 10646 (Unicode).  This means that
     unit string specifications like "`µ°F·Ω⁻¹'" are now supported (your
     viewer must support UTF-8 to display this string correctly).

   * *Support for logarithmic units:*  The unit string specification
     "`0.1 lg(re 1 mW)'" specifies a deciBel unit with a one milliwatt
     reference level.  Such units are fully integrated into the package
     and all meaningful operations and conversions are supported.

   * *Persistent value converters:* It is now possible to obtain a
     _converter_ data-object, which can be used to convert numeric
     values in one unit to numeric values in another, compatible unit.
     The values can be `float', `double', or one-dimensional arrays of
     `float's or `double's.

   * *Improved API:*  Due to the above changes, it was not possible to
     keep the application programming interface (API) of the original
     `UDUNITS' package.  The new interface, however, is easily
     understood and easy to use.  To support backward comptibility, the
     package does contain a version 1 C API, which uses the version 2
     library.

   * *XML unit database:*  The unit database is encoded using
     human-readable XML rather than a custom format.  The XML parser
     included in the package supports an _<import>_ element to allow
     easy and convenient customization.

   * *No Fortran or Perl API:*  Interfaces for these languages have not
     yet been created.  Contact <support-udunits@unidata.ucar.edu> if
     you are interested in helping to create these interfaces.


   One thing that has not changed is that almost all unit string
specifications understood by the original `UDUNITS' package are also
understood by the new `UDUNITS-2' package.  The one exception is the
symbol `g', which in the original package was associated with standard
free fall (a unit of accelleration) but which is associated with gram
in the new package.

3 Obtaining this Package
************************

Get this package from its download-page at
`http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/udunits/' and unpack it in an
appropriate place, e.g.,

     cd /usr/local/src
     gunzip -c udunits-2.1.21.tar.gz | pax -r

4.1 Short Installation Instructions
===================================

Not all development enviroments can build and install this package.
See the long instructions in the next section for details.

   The following assumes that you are familiar with autoconf-based
package-installation.  If you're not, then follow the long instructions
in the next section.

     ./configure [--prefix=ROOT] [--disable-shared] [CC=PATH]
     make
     make check                      # optional; requires CUNIT installation
     make install                    # also installs INFO documentation
     make install-html install-pdf   # optional
     make clean

   By default, the installation root is `/usr/local'.

   If you encounter problems, then follow the instructions in the next
section.

4.2 Long Installation Instructions
==================================

  1. Go to the top-level source-directory of this package, e.g.,
          cd udunits-2.1.21

  2. Because some `make' utilities cannot build this package correctly,
     locate the operating system that is closest to yours in the
     following table and determine the MAKE utility that you will use.

          O/S                            `make' Utility
          ------------------------------------------------------- 

  3. If necessary, clean-up from a previous installation attempt by
     making the `distclean' target using the MAKE utility from step 2:
          MAKE distclean

  4. Because some compilers cannot build this package correctly, locate
     the operating system closest to yours in the following table and
     determine the compiler that you will use and any required option
     for the `configure' script.

          O/S                            Compiler                  `configure' Option
          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

     The option `--disable-shared' causes the build process to create a
     static library only: a sharable library is not created.  This
     option is necessary if the `libtool' utility that's included in
     this package can't build a sharable library using the given
     compiler.

     The following table lists the build environments that do not work
     -- so don't use them:

          O/S                            Compiler                  `configure' Option
          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

  5. Execute the `configure' script.  Specify the installation prefix,
     the compiler from the previous step, and any required option.  For
     example, if you are on an HP-UX system and want to use the
     `/bin/c89' compiler and install under `/opt', then the following
     command is appropriate:

          ./configure --prefix=/opt --disable-shared CC=/bin/c89

     If the installation prefix is not specified, then the default is
     to install under `/usr/local'.

     If the compiler isn't specified, then the default is to use `gcc'.

  6. Build this package by making the default target using the MAKE
     utility from step 2:
          MAKE

  7. If you wish to verify that this package works correctly, then make
     the `check' target using the MAKE utility from step 2:
          MAKE check
     This step is only effective if the `configure' script found an
     installed `CUNIT' unit-testing package.  If that package wasn't
     found, then the above command will quickly exit without testing
     this package.

  8. Install the *note library: (udunits2lib)Top, *note utility:
     (udunits2prog)Top, header-files, units-database, and INFO
     documentation files by making the `install' target using the MAKE
     utility from step 2:
          MAKE install

  9. If desired, install the HTML and PDF documentation files by making
     one or more of the following targets using the MAKE utility from
     step 2:
          MAKE install-html install-pdf

 10. Clean up by making the `clean' target using the MAKE utility from
     step 2:
          MAKE clean
