The NetCDF CF Library Users Guide and Reference

This guide describes libcf, the netCDF CF Library. This document
applies to libcf version 1.0-alpha5, and was last updated on 30 June
2011.

Summary
*******

The CF conventions for climate and forecast metadata are designed to
promote the processing and sharing of files created with the netCDF API.

   This library, libcf, makes it easier to create and work with data
files which conform to the CF conventions.

   The functions of the CF library are intended to be interspersed with
netCDF library calls. That is, the programmer will open or create a
netCDF file with the netCDF API, and then add or read metadata with
libcf library functions, then continue to working with the netCDF API
to read and write data.

   By using libcf, a data producer can produce files that conform to the
CF standards, without having to write netCDF code to create and decode
all the attributes that the CF convention uses to store meta-data. A
data consumer can use libcf to read any file which conforms to the CF
conventions; the file does not need to be created with libcf to be read
by libcf.

   Fortran-77 wrapper functions provide a Fortran 77 API, just as is
done with netCDF itself. A Fortran 90 API is planned, but not yet begun.

   For more information about the CF Conventions, see the CF Metadata
web site at `http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/CF-1.0.html'.

Downloading and Installing libcf
********************************

Currently, and for some time to come, libcf is in alpha release. The
code is tested, but not extensively. The API may be extended, and
possibly changed, in each release.

   You must have either netCDF-3 (or netCDF-4) installed. And reasonably
recent version of netCDF should work. libcf is tested with netCDF
3.6.2-beta4.

   Get the latest version of the libcf tarball at the libcf ftp site:
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/libcf

   Unpack the tarball, and run:

     ./configure --with-netcdf=/my/netcdf --prefix=/my/libcf && make check install > output.txt

   Where /my/netcdf is the root install directory of the netCDF library
you want to use, and /my/libcf is the root directory where you want
libcf installed. (They may be the same directory.)

   If you wish to use netCDF-4, you must also have HDF5 and libz, the
compression library, installed. In this case, configure libcf like this:

     ./configure --with-netcdf=/s/n4_new1/install --enable-netcdf-4 --with-hdf5=/home/ed/local/s && make check install > output.txt

   If the build does not work for you, please email libcf support:
support-libcf@unidata.ucar.edu. Please send the *complete* output of the
configure and build output, in ASCII (the output.txt file produced by
the above build commands), and the file config.log, which is generated
by the configure script.

1 The cfcheck Utility
*********************

The cfchck utility will chck a file to see if it contains valid CF
metadata. Messages about the file are printed to stdout.

2.1 Mark a File as Conforming to CF Conventions
===============================================

Mark the file as following CF-1.0 conventions.

   This functions is called automatically by nccf_def_file, so need not
be called by the user if nccf_def_file is being called.

Usage
=====

        int nccf_def_convention(int ncid);

`ncid'
     The ncid of the file.


Return Codes
============

This function returns zero for success, or a netCDF error code for
failure.

Example
=======

2.2 Determine if a File Claims to Conform to CF Conventions
===========================================================

Determine if the file claims to follow CF-1.0 conventions. This
function only checks the global "Conventions" attribute. It does not
look at file metadata to ensure that this is a well-formed CF file. It
only tells whether the file claims to be a CF file.

Usage
=====

        int nccf_inq_convention(int ncid, int *cf_convention);

`ncid'
     The ncid of the file.

`cf_conventions'
     If this pointer to an int is provided, a 1 is written there if this
     file claims to follow CF 1.0 conventions, a 0 otherwise.


Return Codes
============

This function returns zero for success, or a netCDF error code for
failure.

2.3 Add description to the data with nccf_def_file
==================================================

Add some or all of the CF recommended text attributes to a file. Any
parameters which are set to NULL will be ignored.

Usage
=====

     int nccf_def_file(int ncid, char *title, char *history, char *institution,
                       char *source, char *comment, char *references);

`ncid'
     The ncid of the file.

`title'
     If non-NULL, this text string will be written as the CF-recommended
     "title" attribute.

`history'
     If non-NULL, this text string will be written as the CF-recommended
     "history" attribute.

`institution'
     If non-NULL, this text string will be written as the CF-recommended
     "institution" attribute.

`source'
     If non-NULL, this text string will be written as the CF-recommended
     "source" attribute.

2.4 Read the description of the data with nccf_inq_file
=======================================================

Read any existing CF recommended text attributes from the file.

   Recall that in C, strlens do not include the null terminator. To get
the lengths before the strings (in order to allocated) pass NULL for
any or all strings and the lengths will be returned. Then call the
function again after allocating memory.

   The CF version is guaranteed to be less than NC_MAX_NAME.

   Any of these pointer arguments may be NULL, in which case it will be
ignored.
