.SH GRID FILE FORMATS
By default BD(GMT) writes out grid as single precision floats in a COARDS-complaint netCDF file format.
However, BD(GMT) is able to produce grid files in many other commonly used grid file formats and also facilitates so called "packing" of grids,
writing out floating point data as 2- or 4-byte integers. To specify the precision, scale and offset, the user should add the suffix
GMT_GRD_SUFFIX, where IT(id) is a two-letter identifier of the grid type and precision, and IT(scale) and IT(offset) are optional scale factor
and offset to be applied to all grid values, and IT(nan) is the value used to indicate missing data.
See BD(grdreformat)(1) and Section 4.17 of the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook for more information.
.P
When writing a netCDF file, the grid is stored by default with the variable name "z". To specify another variable name IT(varname),
append BD(?)IT(varname) to the file name.  Note that you may need to escape the special meaning of BD(?) in your shell program
by putting a backslash in front of it, or by placing the filename and suffix between quotes or double quotes.
