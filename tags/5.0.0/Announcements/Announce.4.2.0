Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.2.0.
For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook or
follow the RELEASES link on the updated GMT web page
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).  GMT 4.2.0 is a recommended
upgrade for all users; it also fixes earlier Windows DLL
problems in 4.1.4.

At this point, the US mirrors have synced up, and we expect
the others to follow within 24 hours.  Note the Australia
mirror is still down.


Sincerely,

The GMT Team
