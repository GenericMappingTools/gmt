#	Original GMT Guru Makefile Macro for the main GNUmakefile
#	Gurus should make a file gmtguru.macros to overrule any setting below.
#	DO NOT edit this file - it is in CVS and you will loose any changes!
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The GNUmakefile file for GMT can be used by any GMT Developer to do chores
# ranging from compiling and linking and running examples, to preparing new
# tar archives for release.
# Any developer may create a tar distribution locally with the GNUmakefile for
# testing purposes.
#
# This file is included in GNUmakefile along with the file gmtguru.macros,
# in which any guru can overrule the setting below. For example:
#
# GMT_DEBUG=
# GMT_SHARED_LIBS=--enable-shared
#
# in the file gmtguru.macros will switch debugging code off and building
# of shared libraries on.
#
# You may want to override the following with your own settings to reflect your
# particular computer environment.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
AUTOCONF	= autoconf		# GNU autoconf utility (add path if not in your search path)
GMT_SHARED_LIBS	=# --enable-shared	# --enable-shared for shared; empty for static libraries
GMT_US		=# --enable-US		# --enable-US for inch; empty for cm
GMT_TRIANGLE	= --enable-triangle	# --enable-triangle for Shewchuk's triangulation; empty for Watson's
GMT_DEBUG	= --enable-debug	# --enable-debug will use -g; else -O with compiler
GMT_NETCDF	=# --enable-netcdf=$(NETCDFHOME)	# Change if your netcdf can not be found automatically
GMT_SITE	=# --enable-update=ftp.soest.hawaii.edu	# Specify your nearest GMT ftp mirror
GMT_MATLAB	=# --enable-matlab=$(MATLAB)	# To compile the mex supplement for Matlab
GMT_OCTAVE	=# --enable-octave=yes	# To compile the mex supplement for Octave
GMT_64		=# --enable-64		# Compile for 64-bit platforms
GMT_UNIVERSAL	=# --enable-universal	# Make universal binaries under OS X

# The following two will let you tailor where GMT will install
# (1) machine-specific executables/libraries and
# (2) machine-independent files such as the stuff in share, man pages etc.
# By default they are all installed in the main GMT directory.
# Uncomment these two to change this behavior:

GMT_DIST	=# --prefix=/usr/local/gmt 		# Uncomment for alternate installation path for machine-independent files (man, web)
GMT_EXDIST	=# --exec_prefix=/usr/local/gmt/linux	# Uncomment for alternate installation path for executables

# Specify any options in GMT_OTHER that are not already mentioned above, e.g. --disable-mex

GMT_OTHER	= --disable-xgrid --disable-mex		# Do not compile things that depend on X11 or Matlab/Octave

# Choose the correct preprocessing command for your system (this is for man page processing only).
# 'configure' already knows how to deal with the ones listed below.
#
#TXT2MAN	= /usr/bin/cpp -w -P -nostdinc	# Linux/Darwin
#TXT2MAN	= /usr/ccs/lbin/cpp		# HPUX
#TXT2MAN	= cc -E -Xs			# Solaris Workshop
