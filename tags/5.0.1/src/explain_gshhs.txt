.SH GSHHS INFORMATION
The coastline database is GSHHS which is compiled from two sources:
World Vector Shorelines (WVS) and CIA World Data Bank II (WDBII).
In particular, all level-1 polygons (ocean-land boundary) are derived
from the more accurate WVS while all higher level polygons (level 2-4,
representing land/lake, lake/island-in-lake, and island-in-lake/lake-in-island-in-lake boundaries)
are taken from WDBII.  Much processing has taken place to convert WVS
and WDBII data into usable form for BD(GMT):
assembling closed polygons from line segments, checking for duplicates,
and correcting for crossings between polygons.  The area of each polygon
has been determined so that the user may choose not to draw features smaller
than a minimum area (see OPT(A)); one may also limit the highest hierarchical
level of polygons to be included (4 is the maximum).  The 4 lower-resolution
databases were derived from the full resolution database using the
Douglas-Peucker line-simplification algorithm.  The classification of rivers
and borders follow that of the WDBII.  See the BD(GMT) Cookbook and
Technical Reference Appendix K for further details.
