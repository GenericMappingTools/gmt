.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(psxyz) reads (x,y,z) triplets from IT(files) [or standard input] and
generates IT(PostScript) code that will plot lines, polygons, or symbols at those locations in 3-D.
If a symbol is selected and no symbol size given, then BD(psxyz) will interpret the fourth column of the
input data as symbol size.  Symbols whose IT(size) is <= 0 are skipped.
If no symbols are specified then the symbol code (see OPT(S) below)
must be present as last column in the input.
If OPT(S) is not used, a line connecting the data points will be drawn instead.
To explicitly close polygons, use OPT(L).  Select a fill with OPT(G).
If OPT(G) is set, OPT(W) will control whether the polygon outline is drawn or not.
If a symbol is selected, OPT(G) and OPT(W) determines the fill and outline/no outline, respectively.
The IT(PostScript) code is written to standard output.

.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
#include "explain_intables.txt"
#include "explain_-B.txt"
.TP
OPT(C)IT(cptfile)
Give a color palette file.  If OPT(S) is set, let symbol fill color be determined by the
t-value in the fourth column. Additional fields are shifted over by one column
(optional size would be in 5th rather than 4th field, etc.).
If OPT(S) is not set, then BD(psxyz) expects the user to supply a multisegment file
(where each segment header contains a OPT(Z)IT(val) string.  The IT(val)
will control the color of the line or polygon (if OPT(L) is set) via the cpt file.
.TP
OPT(D)IT(dx)/IT(dy)[IT(dz)]
Offset the plot symbol or line locations by the given amounts IT(dx/dy)[IT(dz)] [Default is no offset].
.TP
OPT(G)IT(fill)
Select color or pattern for filling of symbols or polygons [Default is no fill].
.br
Note that BD(psxyz) will search for OPT(G) and OPT(W)
strings in all the segment headers and let any values thus found over-ride the command line settings.
.TP
OPT(I)IT(intens)
Use the supplied IT(intens) value (nominally in the -1 to + 1 range) to modulate the fill color by simulating illumination [none].
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
OPT(L)
Force closed polygons: connect the endpoints of the line-segment(s) and draw polygons.
Also, in concert with OPT(C) and any OPT(Z) settings in the headers will use the implied
color for polygon fill [Default is polygon pen color].
OPT(N)
Do NOT skip symbols that fall outside map border [Default plots points inside border only].
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
OPT(Q)
Turn off the automatic sorting of items based on their distance from the viewer.  The default is
to sort the items so that items in the foreground are plotted after items in the background.
#define THREE_D
#include "explain_symbols.txt"
#include "explain_-U.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(W)[BD(-)|BD(+)][IT(pen)]
Set pen attributes for lines or the outline of symbols [Defaults: width = default, color = black, style = solid].
A leading BD(+) will use the lookup color (via OPT(C)) for both symbol fill and outline pen color, while a leading
BD(-) will set outline pen color and turn off symbol fill.

The OPT(g) option is ignored if OPT(S) is set.

.SH EXAMPLES
To plot blue columns (width = LEN_1 cm) at the positions listed in the file heights.xyz on a
3-D projection of the space (0\-10), (0\-10), (0\-100),  with tickmarks every 2, 2, and 10,
viewing it from the southeast at 30 degree elevation, use:
.br
.sp
psxyz heights.xyz -R0/10/0/10/0/100 OPT_1
-Gblue -B2:XLABEL:/2:YLABEL:/10:ZLABEL::."3-D PLOT":15 -p135/30 -Uc -W -P > heights.ps
.SH SEGMENT HEADER PARSING
Segment header records may contain one of more of the following options:
.br
OPT(G)IT(fill) Use the new IT(fill) and turn filling on
.br
OPT(G-) Turn filling off
.br
OPT(G) Revert to default fill (none if not set on command line)
.br
OPT(W)IT(pen) Use the new IT(pen) and turn outline on
.br
OPT(W) Revert to default pen ()MAP_DEFAULT_PENBD( if not set on command line)
.br
OPT(W-) Turn outline off
.br
OPT(Z)IT(zval) Obtain fill via cpt lookup using z-value IT(zval)
.br
OPT(ZNaN) Get the NaN color from the cpt file
.SH CUSTOM SYMBOLS
BD(psxyz) allows users to define and plot their own custom symbols.
This is done by encoding the symbol using our custom symbol macro code described in Appendix N.
Put all the macro codes for your new symbol in a file whose extension must be .def; you may then address
the symbol without giving the extension (e.g., the symbol file tsunami.def is used by specifying OPT(Sk)IT(tsunami/size).
The definition file can contain any number of plot code records, as well as blank lines and comment lines (starting with #).
BD(psxyz) will look for the definition files in (1) the current directory, (2) the ~/.gmt
directory, and (3) the BD($GMT_SHAREDIR)/custom directory, in that order.
Freeform polygons (made up of straight line segments and arcs of circles) can be designed - these polygons can be
painted and filled with a pattern.  Other standard geometric symbols can also be used.  See Appendix N for macro definitions.
.SH BUGS
No hidden line removal is employed for polygons and lines.  Symbols, however, are first sorted
according to their distance from the viewpoint so that nearby symbols will overprint more distant
ones should they project to the same x,y position.
.br
BD(psxyz) cannot handle filling of polygons that contain the south or north pole.  For such a polygon,
make a copy and split it into two and make each explicitly contain the polar point.  The two polygons
will combine to give the desired effect when filled; to draw outline use the original polygon.
.br
The OPT(N) option does not adjust the BoundingBox information so you may
have to post-process the IT(PostScript) output with BD(ps2raster) OPT(A) to obtain
the correct BoundingBox.
