GMT is an open source collection of ~65 tools for manipulating
geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend
fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing Encapsulated
PostScript File (EPS) illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots
via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D
perspective views; the GMT supplements add another ~70 more
specialized tools. GMT supports over 30 map projections and
transformations and comes with support data such as GSHHS
coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries. GMT is developed and
maintained by Paul Wessel, Walter H. F. Smith, Remko Scharroo, and
Joaquim Luis, with help from a global set of volunteers, and is
supported by the National Science Foundation. It is released under
the GNU Lesser General Public License.
