Dear GMT user-

We are pleased to announce the release of GMT version 4.3.0.
For a complete list of enhancements and features, please
see Chapter 1 in the Technical Reference & Cookbook online
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).  GMT 4.3.0 is a recommended
upgrade for all users.  It also is required if you plan to
take advantage of GMT's 64-bit support or use GMT with Octave.
GMT 4.3.0 also uses the revised GSHHS v.1.10 coastlines. We
now also distribute Windows Installers rather than zip files.

At this point, all mirrors but Tokai appear to have synced up.
We are also pleased to announce a new Australia mirror at
the University of Sydney.


Sincerely,

The GMT Team
May-3-2008
