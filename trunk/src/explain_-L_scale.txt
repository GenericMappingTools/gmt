.B \-L
Draws a simple map scale centered on \fIlon0/lat0\fP.  Use \fB\-Lx\fP to specify x/y position instead.
Scale is calculated at latitude \fIslat\fP (optionally supply longitude \fIslon\fP for oblique projections
[Default is central meridian]), \fIlength\fP is in km [miles if \fBm\fP is appended; nautical miles
if \fBn\fP is appended]. Use \fB\-Lf\fP to get a "fancy" scale [Default is plain]. The default label equals the
distance unit (km, miles, nautical miles) and is justified on top of the scale [t].  Change this by giving your
own label (or - to keep the default) and justification (l(eft), r(ight), t(op), b(ottom), and u(unit) - using
the label as a unit appended to all distance annotations along the scale).  If you want to place a rectangle
behind the scale, specify pen and/or fill parameters with the \fB+p\fP and \fB+f\fP modifiers.
