.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdcontour\fP reads a 2-D gridded file and produces a contour map by tracing
each contour through the grid.  As an option, the x/y/z positions of the contour lines may be dumped to
a single multisegment file or many separate files.  \fIPostScript\fP code is generated and sent to standard output.  Various options
that affect the plotting are available.
.br
	No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.  Use upper case for the
option flags and lower case for modifiers.
.TP
\fIgrdfile\fP
2-D gridded data set to be contoured
.TP
.B \-C
The contours to be drawn may be specified in one of three possible ways:
.br
If \fIcont_int\fP has the suffix ".cpt" and can be opened as a file, it is assumed
to be a color palette table.  The color boundaries are then used as contour levels.
If the cpt-file has annotation flags in the last column then those contours will be
annotated.  By default all contours are labeled; use \fB\-A\-\fP to disable all annotations.
.br
If \fIcont_int\fP is a file but not a cpt-file, it is expected to contain contour levels
in column 1 and a C(ontour) OR A(nnotate) in col 2. The levels marked C (or c) are contoured,
the levels marked A (or a) are contoured and annotated.  Optionally, a third column may be
present and contain the fixed annotation angle for this contour level.
.br
If no file is found, then \fIcont_int\fP is
interpreted as a constant contour interval.  If \fB\-A\fP is set and \fB\-C\fP is not, then
the contour interval is set equal to the specified annotation interval.
.br
If a file is given and \fB\-T\fP is set, 
then only contours marked with upper case C or A will have tickmarks.  In all cases the contour
values have the same units as the grid.

.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-A
\fIannot_int\fP is annotation interval in data units.  Ignored if contour levels are given in a file.
[Default is no annotations].   Give \fB-\fP to disable all annotations implied by \fB\-C\fP.
The optional \fIlabelinfo\fP controls the specifics of the label formatting and consists of a concatenated string
made up of any of the following control arguments:
.br
#include "explain_labelinfo.txt"
If no name is specified, the unit given in the \fIgrdfile\fP will be used.  
#include "explain_-B_short.txt"
.TP
.B \-D
Dump the (x,y,z) coordinates of each contour to separate files, one for each contour segment. The
files will be named \fIdumpfile_cont_segment[_i]\fP.xyz (or \fI.b\fP is \fB\-b\fP is selected), where \fIcont\fP is the contour value and
\fIsegment\fP is a running segment number for each contour interval (for closed contours we append _i.)  If the prefix is given as '-'
the file names are instead \fIC#_i\fP (interior) or \fIC#_e\fP (external) plus extension, and # is just a running number.  This allows us to
make short file names that will work with GNU utilities under DOS.
However, when \fB\-M\fP
is used in conjunction with \fB\-D\fP a single multisegment file is created instead.
.TP
.B \-E
Sets the viewpoint's azimuth and elevation for perspective view [180/90].\"'

#include "explain_contlabel.txt"
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
.B \-L
Limit range: Do not draw contours for data values below \fIlow\fP or above \fIhigh\fP.
.TP
.B \-M
When used in conjunction with \fB\-D\fP a single multisegment file is created, and
each contour section is preceeded by a header record whose first column is \fIflag\fP
followed by the contour level.
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
.B \-Q
Do not draw contours with less than \fIcut\fP number of points [Draw all contours].
#include "explain_-R.txt"
[Default is region defined in the grd file].
.TP
.B \-S
Used to resample the contour lines at roughly every (gridbox_size/\fIsmoothfactor\fP) interval.
.TP
.B \-T
Will draw tickmarks pointing in the downward direction every \fIgap\fP along the innermost closed contours.
Append \fIgap\fP and tickmark length or use defaults [0.5\fBc\fP/0.1c or 0.2\fBi\fP/0.04i].
User may choose to tick only local highs or local lows by specifying \fB\-T+\fP or \fB\-T-\fP, respectively.
Appending :LH will plot the characters L and H at the center of closed
innermost contours (local lows and highs).  L and H can be any single character (e.g., LH, -+, etc.)
If a file is given by \fB\-C\fP and \fB\-T\fP is set, 
then only contours marked with upper case C or A will have tickmarks [and annotation].
#include "explain_-U.txt"
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
.B \-W
\fItype\fP, if present, can be 'a' for annotated contours or 'c' for regular contours [Default].
\fIpen\fP sets the attributes for the particular line.  Default values for annotated contours:
width = 3, color = black, texture = solid.  Regular contours have default width = 1.  If the
\fB+\fP flag is specified then the color of the contour lines are taken from the cpt file (see \fB\-C\fP).
#include "explain_-XY.txt"
.TP
.B \-Z
Use to subtract \fIshift\fP from the data and multiply the results by \fIfactor\fP before contouring starts [1/0].
(Numbers in \fB\-A, \-C, \-L\fP refer to values after this scaling has occurred.)
Append \fBp\fP to indicate
that this grid file contains z-values that are periodic in 360 degrees (e.g.,
phase data, angular distributions) and that
special precautions must be taken when determining 0-contours.

.SH EXAMPLES
To contour the file hawaii_grav.grd every 25 mGal on a Mercator map at 0.5 inch/degree, annotate
every 50 mGal (using fontsize = 10), using 1 degree tickmarks, and draw 30 minute gridlines:

.br
.sp
To contour the file image.grd using the levels in the file cont.d on a linear projection at 0.1 cm/x-unit
and 50 cm/y-unit, using 20 (x) and 0.1 (y) tickmarks, smooth the contours a bit, use "RMS Misfit" as
plot-title, use a thick red pen for annotated contours, and a thin, dashed, blue pen for the rest, and send the output to the default printer:
.br
.sp
\fBgrdcontour\fP image.grd \fB\-Jx\fP0.1\fBc\fP/50.0\fBc\fP \fB\-C\fPcont.d \fB\-S\fP4 \fB\-B\fP20/0.1:."RMS Misfit":
\fB\-Wa\fP5/255/0/0 \fB\-Wc\fP1/0/0/255\fBta\fP | lp
The labeling of local highs and lows may plot outside the innermost contour since only the mean value
of the contour coordinates is used to position the label.
