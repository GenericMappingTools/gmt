.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(grdimage) reads one 2-D grid file and produces a gray-shaded (or colored) map by plotting
rectangles centered on each grid node and assigning them a gray-shade (or color) based on the z-value.
Alternatively, BD(grdimage) reads three 2-D grid files with the red, green, and blue components
directly (all must be in the 0-255 range). Optionally, illumination may be added by providing
a file with intensities in the (-1,+1) range.  Values outside this range will be clipped.
Such intensity files can be created from the
grid using BD(grdgradient) and, optionally, modified by BD(grdmath) or BD(grdhisteq).
Yet as a third alternative available when GMT is build with GDAL support the grd_z file can be an 
image referenced or not (than see OPT(Dr)). In this case the images can be illuminated with the file 
provided via the OPT(I) option. Here if image has no coordinates those of the intensity file will be used.
.br
When using map projections, the grid is first resampled on a new rectangular grid with the same
dimensions. Higher resolution images can be obtained by using the OPT(E) option.
To obtain the resampled value (and hence shade or color) of each map pixel, its location
is inversely projected back onto the input grid after which a value is interpolated between the
surrounding input grid values. By default bi-cubic interpolation is used.
Aliasing is avoided by also forward projecting the input grid nodes. If two or more nodes are
projected onto the same pixel, their average will dominate in the calculation of the pixel
value. Interpolation and aliasing is controlled with the OPT(n) option.
.br
The OPT(R) option can be used to select a map region larger or smaller than that
implied by the extent of the grid.
.br
A (color) IT(PostScript) file is output.
#include "explain_commonitems.txt"
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(grd_z) | IT(grd_r grd_g grd_b)
2-D gridded data set (or red, green, blue grids) to be imaged
(See GRID FILE FORMATS below.)
.TP
OPT(C)IT(cptfile)
name of the color palette table (for IT(grd_z) only).
#include "explain_-J.txt"
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
OPT(A)
With GDAL aware versions save image in a raster format instead of postscript. Append =<IT(driver)> to select the
image format. The IT(driver) is the driver code name used by GDAL. For example OPT(A)img.tif=GTiff will write a GeoTiff
image if the subset of GMT syntax projections that is currently possible to translate into the PROJ4 syntax allows it,
or a plain tiff file otherwise. Note: any vector elements are lost. 
#include "explain_-B.txt"
.TP
OPT(D)[BD(r)]
Specifies that the grid supplied is an image file to be read via GDAL. Obviously this option will work only with BD(GMT)
versions built with GDAL support. The image can be indexed or true color (RGB) and can
be an URL of a remotely located file. That is OPT(D) http://www.somewhere.com/image.jpg is a valid file syntax.
Note, however, that to use it this way you must not be blocked by a proxy. If you are, chances 
are good that it can work by setting the environmental variable http_proxy with the value 'your_proxy:port'
Append BD(r) to use the region specified by OPT(R) to apply to the image.
For example, if you have used OPT(Rd) then the image will be assigned the limits of a global
domain. The interest of this mode is that you can project a raw image (an image without 
referencing coordinates).
.TP
OPT(Ei)[|IT(dpi)]
Sets the resolution of the projected grid that will be created if
a map projection other than Linear or Mercator was selected [100].  By default,
the projected grid will be of the same size (rows and columns) as the
input file.  Specify BD(i) to use the IT(PostScript)
image operator to interpolate the image at the device resolution.
.TP
OPT(G)[BD(f)|BD(b)]IT(color)
This option only applies when the resulting image otherwise would consist
of only two colors: black (0) and white (255).  If so, this option will
instead use the image as a transparent mask and paint the mask (or its
inverse, with OPT(Gb)) with the given color combination.
.TP
OPT(I)IT(intensfile)
Gives the name of a grid file with intensities in the (-1,+1) range. [Default is no illumination].
#include "explain_-Jz.txt"
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
OPT(M)
Force conversion to monochrome image using the (television) YIQ transformation.
Cannot be used with OPT(Q).
.TP
OPT(N)
Do not clip the image at the map boundary (only relevant for non-rectangular maps).
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
OPT(Q)
Make grid nodes with z = NaN transparent, using the colormasking feature in IT(PostScript) Level 3
(the PS device must support PS Level 3).
#include "explain_-R.txt"
#include "explain_-Rz.txt"
You may ask for a larger IT(w/e/s/n) region to have more room between the image and the axes.
A smaller region than specified in the grid file will result in a subset of the grid
[Default is the region given by the grid file].

.SH IMAGING GRIDS WITH NANS
Be aware that if your input grid contains patches of NaNs, these patches can become larger
as a consequence of the resampling that must take place with most map projections.  Because
BD(grdimage) uses the IT(PostScript) colorimage operator, for most non-linear projections
we must resample your grid onto an equidistant rectangular lattice.  If you find that the NaN
areas are not treated adequately, consider (a) use a linear projection, or (b) use
BD(grdview) OPT(Ts) instead.
