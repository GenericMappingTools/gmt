.SH GRID VALUES PRECISION
Regardless of the precision of the input data, GMT programs that create
grid files will internally hold the grids in 4-byte floating point
arrays.  This is done to conserve memory and furthermore most if not all
real data can be stored using 4-byte floating point values.  Data with
higher precision (i.e., double precision values) will lose that precision
once GMT operates on the grid or writes out new grids.  To limit loss
of precision when processing data you should always consider normalizing
the data prior to processing.
