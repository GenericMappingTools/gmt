Dump the (x,y,z) coordinates of each contour to one or more output files (or IT(stdout) if IT(template) is not given).
No plotting will take place.  If IT(template) contains one or more of the C-format specifiers %d, %f, %c then
line segments will be written to different files; otherwise all lines are written to the specified file (IT(template)).
The use of the C-format specifiers controls how many files are created and how the contours are organized.
If the float format %f is present (standard modifications to width and precision are allowed, e.g., %f7.3f), then
the filenames will contain the contour value and lines are thus separated into files based on a common contour value.  If
there are IT(N) contours then you will obtain IT(N) files.
If the integer format %d is present (including modifications like %5.5d), then all contours are written to individual
segment files; if any of the other specifiers are present they just affect the file names.  Finally, if the
character format %c is present it is replaced with the letters C (for closed) or O (for open), reflecting the nature
of each contour.  Any combination of one, two, or all three modifiers are valid, resulting in different filenames
and number of files.  For instance, if %c appears by itself, then only two files are created, separating the open from
the closed contours (assuming both kinds are present).  If just %f is used, then all segments for the same contour
level will be written to the same file, resulting in IT(N) multi-segment files. If both %f and %c were combined then
each contour level would be further subdivided into closed and open contours.  Any combination involving %d will
result in one individual file for each segment; %c, %f only modifies the file names.
The files are ASCII unless OPT(bo) is used.
