.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(x2sys_init) IT(TAG) OPT(D)IT(deffile) [ OPT(Cc)|BD(f)|BD(g)|BD(e) ] [ OPT(E)IT(suffix) ] 
[ OPT(F) ] [ OPT(Gd)|BD(g) ] [ OPT(I)IT(dx)[/IT(dy)] ] [ OPT(Nd)|BD(s)IT(unit) ] 
[ GMT_Rgeo_OPT ] [ GMT_V_OPT ] [ OPT(Wt)|BD(d)IT(gap) ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(x2sys_init) is the starting point for anyone wishing to use x2sys; it initializes
a set of data bases that are particular to one kind of track data.  These data,
their associated data bases, and key parameters are given a short-hand
notation called an x2sys TAG.   The TAG keeps track of settings such as file format,
whether the data are geographic or not, and the binning resolution for track indices.
Running BD(x2sys_init) is a prerequisite to running any of the other x2sys programs,
such as BD(x2sys_binlist), which will
create a crude representation of where each data track go within the domain
and which observations are available; this information serves as input to
BD(x2sys_put) which updates the track data base. Then, BD(x2sys_get) can
be used to find which tracks and data are available inside a given region.
With that list of tracks you can use BD(x2sys_cross) to calculate track
crossovers, use BD(x2sys_report) to report crossover statistics or
BD(x2sys_list) to pull out selected crossover information
that BD(x2sys_solve) can use to determine track-specific systematic corrections.  These
corrections may be used with BD(x2sys_datalist) to extract corrected
data values for use in subsequent work.
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(TAG)
The unique name of this data type x2sys TAG.
.TP
OPT(D)IT(deffile)
Definition file prefix for this data set [See DEFINITION FILES below for more information].
Specify full path if the file is not in the current directory.
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
OPT(Cc)|BD(f)|BD(g)|BD(e)
Select procedure for along-track distance calculation when needed by other programs:
.br
BD(c) Cartesian distances [Default, unless OPT(G) is set].
.br
BD(f) Flat Earth distances.
.br
BD(g) Great circle distances [Default if OPT(G) is set].
.br
BD(e) Geodesic distances on current BD(GMT) ellipsoid.
.TP
OPT(E)IT(suffix)
Specifies the file extension (suffix) for these data files.  If not given we use the
definition file prefix as the suffix (see OPT(D)).
.TP
OPT(F)
Force creating new files if old ones are present [Default will abort if old TAG files are found].
.TP
OPT(Gd)|BD(g)
Selects geographical coordinates.  Append BD(d) for discontinuity at the
Dateline (makes longitude go from -180 to + 180) or BD(g) for discontinuity
at Greenwich (makes longitude go from 0 to 360 [Default]).  If not given we
assume the data are Cartesian.
.TP
OPT(I)IT(dx)[/IT(dy)]
IT(x_inc) [and optionally IT(y_inc)] is the grid spacing. Append BD(m) to
indicate minutes or BD(c) to indicate seconds for geographic data.  These
spacings refer to the binning used in the track bin-index data base.
.TP
OPT(Nd)|BD(s)IT(unit)
Sets the units used for distance and speed when requested by other programs.
Append BD(d) for distance or BD(s) for speed, then give the desired IT(unit) as
BD(c) (Cartesian userdist or userdist/usertime), BD(e) (meter or m/s), BD(k) (km or km/hr), BD(m) (miles or miles/hr), or
BD(n) (nautical miles or knots).  [Default is OPT(Ndk) OPT(Nse) (km and m/s) if OPT(G) is set
and OPT(Ndc) and OPT(Nsc) otherwise (Cartesian units)].
#include "explain_-Rgeo.txt"
For Cartesian data just give IT(xin/xmax/ymin/ymax).  This sets the complete domain
for the relevant track data set.
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(Wt)|BD(d)IT(gap)
Give BD(t) or BD(d) and append the corresponding
maximum time gap (in user units; this is typically seconds [Infinity]), or distance
(for units, see OPT(N)) gap [Infinity]) allowed between
the two data points immediately on either side of a crossover.  If these limits are
exceeded then a data gap is assumed and no COE will be determined.
#include "explain_help.txt"
.SH DEFINITION FILES
These *.def files contain information about the data file format and
have two sections: (1) header information and (2) column information.  All
header information starts with the character # in the first column, immediately
followed by an upper-case directive.  If the directive takes an argument it is
separated by white-space.  You may append a trailing # comments.
Five directives are recognized:
.br
.sp
BD(ASCII) states that the data files are in ASCII format.
.br
BD(BINARY) states that the data files are native binary files.
.br
BD(NETCDF) states that the data files are COARDS-compliant 1-D netCDF files.
.br
BD(SKIP) takes an integer argument which is either the number of lines to
skip (when reading ASCII files) or the number of bytes to skip (when reading
native binary files). Not used with netCDF files.
.br
BD(GEO) indicates that these files are geographic data sets, with periodicities in
the IT(x)-coordinate (longitudes).  Alternatively, use OPT(G).
.br
BD(MULTISEG) means each track consists of multiple segments separated
by a BD(GMT) segment header (alternatively, use OPT(m) when defining
the system TAG). Not used with netCDF files.
.br
.sp
The column information consists of one line per column in the order the
columns appear in the data file.  For each column you must provide  seven
attributes:
.sp
.br
IT(name type NaN NaN-proxy scale offset oformat)
.br
.sp
IT(name) is the name of the column variable.  It is expected that you will use
the special names IT(lon) (or IT(x) if Cartesian) and IT(lat) (or IT(y))
for the two required coordinate columns, and IT(time) when optional time data
are present.
.br
IT(type) is always BD(a) for ASCII representations of numbers, whereas for
binary files you may choose among
BD(c) for signed 1-byte character (-127,+128), BD(u) for unsigned
byte (0-255), BD(h) for signed 2-byte integers (-32768,+32767),
BD(i) for  signed 4-byte integers (-2,147,483,648,+2,147,483,647),
BD(f) for 4-byte floating points and BD(d) for 8-byte double
precision floating points.  For netCDF, simply use BD(d) as netCDF
will automatically handle type-conversions during reading.
.br
IT(NaN) is Y if certain values (e.g, -9999) are to be replaced by NAN, and N otherwise.
.br
IT(NaN-proxy) is that special value (e.g., -9999).
.br
IT(scale) is used to multiply the data after reading.
.br
IT(offset) is used to add to the scaled data.
.br
IT(oformat) is a C-style format string used to print values from this column.
.br
.sp
If you give - as the IT(oformat) then BD(GMT)'s formatting machinery will be used\"'
instead (i.e., BD(FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT), BD(FORMAT_GEO_MAP), BD(FORMAT_DATE_MAP), BD(FORMAT_CLOCK_MAP)).
Some file formats already have definition files premade.  These include
mgd77 (for plain ASCII MGD77 data files), mgd77+ (for enhanced MGD77+
netCDF files), gmt (for old mgg supplement binary files), xy (for plain ASCII
x, y tables), xyz (same, with one z-column), geo (for plain ASCII longitude,
latitude files), and geoz (same, with one z-column).
.SH EXAMPLES
If you have a large set of track data files you can organize them using the
x2sys tools.  Here we will outline the steps.  Let us assume that your track
data file format consist of 2 header records with text information followed
by any number of identically formatted data records with 6 columns (lat,
lon, time, obs1, obs2, obs3) and that files are called *.trk. We will call
this the "line" format.  First, we create the line.def file:
.br
.sp
BD()# Define file for the line format
.br
BD()#ASCII		# File is ASCII
.br
BD()#SKIP 2		# Skip 2 header records
.br
BD()#GEO		# Data are geographic
.br
BD()#name	type 	NaN	NaN-proxy	scale offset oformat
.br
lat	a	N	0	1	0	%9.5f
.br
lon	a	N	0	1	0	%10.5f
.br
time	a	N	0	1	0	%7.1f
.br
obs1	a	N	0	1	0	%7.2f
.br
obs2	a	N	0	1	0	%7.2f
.br
obs3	a	N	0	1	0	%7.2f
.br
.sp
.br
Next we create the TAG and the TAG directory with the databases for these line track files.
Assuming these contain geographic data and that we want to keep track of the
data distribution at a 1 x 1 degree resolution, with distances in km calculated
along geodesics and with speeds given in knots, we may run
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_init) LINE OPT(V) OPT(G) OPT(D)line OPT(Rg) OPT(Ce) OPT(Ndk) OPT(NsN) OPT(I)1/1 OPT(E)trk
.br
.sp
where we have selected LINE to be our x2sys tag.  When x2sys tools try to read your
line data files they will first look in the current directory and second look
in the file IT(TAG)_paths.txt for a list of additional directories to examine.
Therefore, create such a file (here LINE_paths.txt) and stick the full paths to
your data directories there.  All TAG-related files (definition files, tag files,
and track data bases created) will be expected to be in the directory pointed to
by BD($X2SYS_HOME)/IT(TAG) (in our case BD($X2SYS_HOME)/LINE).  Note that
the argument to OPT(D) must contain the full path if the *.def file is not in
the current directory.  BD(x2sys_init) will copy this file to the BD($X2SYS_HOME)/IT(TAG)
directory where all other x2sys tools will expect to find it.
.br
.TP
.B Create tbf file(s):
Once the (empty) TAG databases have been initialized we go through a
two-step process to populate them.  First we run BD(x2sys_binlist) on
all our track files to create one (or more) multisegment track bin-index
files (tbf).  These contain information on which 1 x 1 degree bins (or any
other blocksize; see OPT(I)) each
track has visited and which observations (in your case obs1, obs2, obs3)
were actually observed (not all tracks may have all three kinds of
observations everywhere).  For instance, if your tracks are listed in
the file tracks.lis we may run this command:
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_binlist) OPT(V) OPT(T)LINE :tracks.lis > tracks.tbf
.TP
.B Update index data base:
Next, the track bin-index files are fed to BD(x2sys_put)
which will insert the information into the TAG databases:
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_put) OPT(V) OPT(T)LINE tracks.tbf
.TP
.B Search for data:
You may now use BD(x2sys_get) to find all the tracks within a certain
sub-region, and optionally limit the search to those tracks that have
a particular combination of observables.  E.g., to find all the tracks
which has both obs1 and obs3 inside the specified region, run
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_get) OPT(V) OPT(T)LINE OPT(R)20/40/-40/-20 OPT(F)obs1,obs3 > tracks.tbf
.TP
.B MGD77[+] or GMT:
Definition files already exist for MGD77 files (both standard ASCII and
enhanced netCDF-based MGD77+ files) and the old *.gmt files manipulated by the
mgg supplements; for these data sets the OPT(C) and OPT(N) will default to
great circle distance calculation in km and speed in m/s.  There are also
definition files for plain x,y[,z] and lon,lat[,z] tracks.
To initiate new track databases to be used with MGD77 data from NGDC, try
.br
.sp
BD(x2sys_init) MGD77 OPT(V) OPT(D)mgd77 OPT(E)mgd77 OPT(Rd) OPT(Gd) OPT(Nsn) OPT(I)1/1 OPT(Wt)900  OPT(Wd)5
.br
.sp
where we have chosen a 15 minute (900 sec) or 5 km threshold to indicate a data gap
and selected knots as the speed; the other steps are similar.
.TP
.B Binary files:
Let us pretend that your line files actually are binary files with a
128-byte header structure (to be skipped) followed by the data records
and where IT(lon), IT(lat), IT(time) are double precision numbers while the three
observations are 2-byte integers which must be multiplied by 0.1.
Finally, the first two observations may be -32768 which means there is
no data available.
All that is needed is a different line.def file:
.br
.sp
BD()# Define file for the binary line format
.br
BD()#BINARY	# File is now binary
.br
BD()#SKIP 128	# Skip 128 bytes
.br
BD()#GEO		# Data are geographic
.br
BD()#name	type	 NaN?	NaN-proxy	scale offset oformat
.br
lon	d	N	0	1	0	%10.5f
.br
lat	d	N	0	1	0	%9.5f
.br
time	d	N	0	1	0	%7.1f
.br
obs1	h	Y	-32768	0.1	0	%6.1f
.br
obs2	h	Y	-32768	0.1	0	%6.1f
.br
obs3	h	N	0	0.1	0	%6.1f
.br
.sp
The rest of the steps are identical.  
.TP
.B COARDS 1-D netCDF files:
Finally, suppose that your line files actually are netCDF files that
conform to the COARDS convention, with data columns named
IT(lon), IT(lat), IT(time), IT(obs1), IT(obs2), and IT(obs3).
All that is needed is a different line.def file:
.br
.sp
BD()# Define file for the netCDF COARDS line format
.br
BD()#NETCDF	# File is now netCDF
.br
BD()#GEO		# Data are geographic
.br
BD()#name	type	 NaN?	NaN-proxy	scale offset oformat
.br
lon	d	N	0	1	0	%10.5f
.br
lat	d	N	0	1	0	%9.5f
.br
time	d	N	0	1	0	%7.1f
.br
obs1	d	N	0	1	0	%6.1f
.br
obs2	d	N	0	1	0	%6.1f
.br
obs3	d	N	0	1	0	%6.1f
.br
.sp
Note we use no scaling or NAN proxies since those issues are usually
handled internally in the netCDF format description.
