.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgmtselect\fP is a filter that reads (longitude, latitude) positions from the first 2 columns of
\fIinfiles\fP [or standard input] and uses a combination of 1-6 criteria to pass or reject the records.
Records can be selected based on whether or not they are 1) inside a rectangular region (OPT(R)
[and OPT(J)]), 2) within \fIdist\fP km of any point in \fIptfile\fP, 3) within \fIdist\fP km of
any line in \fIlinefile\fP, 4) inside one of the polygons in the \fIpolygonfile\fP, 5) inside
geographical features (based on coastlines), or 6) has z-values within a given range.
The sense of the tests can be reversed for each of these 6 criteria by using the OPT(I) option.
See option OPT(:) on how to read (latitude,longitude) files.
.TP
\fIinfiles\fP
ASCII (or binary, see OPT(b)) data file(s) to be operated on.  If not given, standard input is read.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
#include "explain_-A.txt"
Ignored unless OPT(N) is set.
.TP
OPT(C)
Pass all records whose location is within \fIdist\fP of any of the points in the ASCII file \fIptfile\fP.
If \fIdist\fP is zero then the 3rd column of \fIptfile\fP must have each point's individual radius of influence.\"'
Distances are Cartesian and in user units; specify OPT(fg) to indicate spherical distances in km.
Use OPT(Cf) to indicate you want flat Earth distances (quicker but approximate) rather than
geodesic distances (slower but exact).
If \fBELLIPSOID\fP is spherical then geodesics become great circles (faster to compute than geodesic).
Alternatively, if OPT(R) and OPT(J) are used then geographic coordinates are projected to map coordinates
(in cm, inch, m, or points, as determined by \fBMEASURE_UNIT\fP) before Cartesian distances are compared to \fIdist\fP.
.TP
OPT(D)
Ignored unless OPT(N) is set.  Selects the resolution of the coastline data set to use ((\fBf\fP)ull, (\fBh\fP)igh, (\fBi\fP)ntermediate, (\fBl\fP)ow, or (\fBc\fP)rude).  The
resolution drops off by ~80% between data sets. [Default is \fBl\fP].  Append \fP+\fP to automatically select a lower resolution should
the one requested not be available [abort if not found].  Note that because the coastlines differ in details it is not guaranteed that a point will remain inside [or outside] when a different resolution is selected.
.TP
OPT(F)
Pass all records whose location is within one of the closed polygons in the multiple-segment
file \fIpolygonfile\fP.  For spherical polygons (lon, lat), make sure no consecutive points
are separated by 180 degrees or more in longitude.  Note that \fIpolygonfile\fP must be in ASCII regardless
of whether OPT(b) is used.
#include "explain_-h.txt"
.TP
OPT(I)
Reverses the sense of the test for each of the criteria specified:
.br
	\fBc\fP  select records NOT inside any point's circle of influence.\"'
.br
	\fBf\fP  select records NOT inside any of the polygons.
.br
	\fBl\fP  select records NOT within the specified distance of any line.
.br
	\fBr\fP  select records NOT inside the specified rectangular region.
.br
	\fBs\fP  select records NOT considered inside as specified by OPT(N) (and OPT(A), OPT(D)).
.br
	\fBz\fP  select records NOT within the range specified by OPT(Z).
#include "explain_-J_short.txt"
.TP
OPT(L)
Pass all records whose location is within \fIdist\fP of any of the line segments in the ASCII multiple-segment
file \fIlinefile\fP.  If \fIdist\fP is zero then the 2nd column of each
sub-header in the \fIptfile\fP must have each lines's individual distance value.\"'
Distances are Cartesian and in user units; specify OPT(fg) to indicate spherical distances in km.
If \fBELLIPSOID\fP is spherical then geodesics become great circles (faster to compute than geodesic).
Alternatively, if OPT(R) and OPT(J) are used then geographic coordinates are projected to map coordinates
(in cm, inch, m, or points, as determined by \fBMEASURE_UNIT\fP) before Cartesian distances are compared to \fIdist\fP.
Use OPT(Lp) to ensure only points whose orthogonal projections onto the nearest line-segment
fall within the segments endpoints [Default considers points "beyond" the line's endpoints.\"'
.TP
OPT(N)
Pass all records whose location is inside specified geographical features.
Specify if records should be skipped (s) or kept (k) using 1 of 2 formats:
.br
	OPT(N)\fIwet/dry\fP.
.br
	OPT(N)\fIocean/land/lake/island/pond\fP.
.br
Append \fBo\fP to let points exactly on feature boundaries be considered outside the feature [Default is inside]. [Default is s/k/s/k/s (i.e., s/k), which passes all points on dry land].
#include "explain_-R.txt"
If no map projection is supplied we implicitly set OPT(Jx)1. Note: only supply OPT(J) when your OPT(R)
is indicating a rectangular region in the projected coordinates (i.e., an oblique projection).
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(Z)
Pass all records whose 3rd column (z) lies within the given range.  Input file must have at least
three columns.  To indicate no limit on min or max, specify a hyphen (-).  If your 3rd column
is absolute time then remember to supply OPT(f)2T.
#include "explain_-t.txt"
#include "explain_-bi.txt"
[Default is 2 input columns].
#include "explain_-bo.txt"
[Default is same as input].
#include "explain_-f.txt"
#include "explain_-m.txt"
The OPT(m) option make sure that segment headers in the input files are copied to output, but it has no effect
on the data selection. Selection is always done point by point, not by segment.
#include "explain_precision.txt"
.br
This note applies to ASCII output only in combination with binary or netCDF input or the OPT(:) option.
See also the note below.
.SH NOTE ON PROCESSING ASCII INPUT RECORDS
Unless you are using the OPT(:) option, selected ASCII input records are copied verbatim to output.
That means that options like OPT(foT) and settings like \fBD_FORMAT\fP and \fBOUTPUT_DEGREE_FORMAT\fP
will not have any effect on the output.
On the other hand, it allows selecting records with diverse content, including character strings, quoted
or not, comments, and other non-numerical content.
.SH NOTE ON DISTANCES
If options OPT(C) or OPT(L) are selected then distances are Cartesian and in user units;
use OPT(fg) to imply spherical distances in km and geographical (lon, lat) coordinates.
Alternatively, specify OPT(R) and OPT(J) to measure projected Cartesian distances in map units
(cm, inch, m, or points, as determined by \fBMEASURE_UNIT\fP).
.br
This program has evolved over the years.  Originally, the OPT(R) and OPT(J) were mandatory in order
to handle geographic data, but now there is full support for spherical calculations.  Thus, OPT(J)
should only be used if you want the tests to be applied on projected data and not the original
coordinates.  If OPT(J) is used the distances given via OPT(C) and OPT(L) are projected distances.
.SH EXAMPLES
To extract the subset of data set that is within 300 km of any of the points in pts.d but more than
100 km away from the lines in lines.d, run
.br
.sp
\fBgmtselect\fP lonlatfile OPT(fg) OPT(C)300/pts.d OPT(L)100/lines.d OPT(Il) > subset
.br
.sp
Here, you must specify OPT(fg) so the program knows you are processing geographical data (otherwise
300 would be interpreted as Cartesian distance in x-y units instead of km).
.br
.sp
To keep all points in data.d within the specified region, except the points on land (as determined by the high-resolution
coastlines), use
.br
.sp
\fBgmtselect\fP data.d OPT(R)120/121/22/24 OPT(Dh) OPT(Nk)/\fBs\fP > subset
.br
.sp
To return all points in quakes.d that are inside the spherical polygon lonlatpath.d, try
.br
.sp
\fBgmtselect\fP quakes.d OPT(F)lonlatpath.d OPT(fg) > subset1
.br
.sp
To return all points in stations.d that are within 5 cm of the point in origin.d for a certain projection, try
.br
.sp
\fBgmtselect\fP stations.d OPT(F)origin.d OPT(R)20/50/-10/20 OPT(JM)20c > subset2
