<CENTER><H2>What is GMT?<H2></CENTER>
<P><B>GMT</B> is an open source collection of ~65 tools for
manipulating geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend
fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing Encapsulated PostScript
File (EPS) illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots via contour
maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D perspective views; the
GMT supplements add another ~70 more specialized tools.  GMT supports
over 30 map projections and transformations and comes
with support data such as GSHHS coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries.
