\chapter{\PS\ fonts used by \gmt}
\index{Font!standard}
\thispagestyle{headings}

\GMT\ uses the standard 35 fonts that come with most
\PS\ laserwriters, as well as 4 Japanese fonts, for a total
of 39.  If your printer does not support
some of these fonts, it will automatically substitute the
default font (which is usually Courier).  The following is
a list of the \GMT\ fonts: \\ 

\GMTfig[h]{GMT_App_G}{The standard 35 \PS\ fonts recognized by \gmt.}

For the special fonts Symbol (12) and ZapfDingbats (34), see the
octal charts in Appendix~F.  When specifying fonts in \GMT, you can
either give the entire font name \emph{or} just the font number listed in
this table.  To change the fonts used in plotting basemap frames, see the man
page for \GMTprog{gmtdefaults}.  For direct plotting of text-strings,
see the man page for \GMTprog{pstext}.  To add additional fonts that you
may have purchased or that are available at your institution, see instructions
in the \filename{CUSTOM\_font\_info.d} under the \filename{share} directory.
