<CENTER><H2>Availability of GMT source code</H2></CENTER>

GMT is available via anonymous ftp from several ftp servers; they
all contain the same files as the main server in Hawaii. Because of file
sizes you are strongly encouraged to use the server closest to you.
We distribute a Bourne shell script (install_gmt) that automatically will
get the required archives from the ftp site you choose.  For users
with a slow Internet-connection, Windows users preferring an InstallShield-based
solution, and users who desire large amounts
of supplemental data sets ready to be used with GMT: See the <B>GMT Companion CD-ROM</B>
products distributed by <A HREF="http://www.geoware-online.com" target="_blank"><B>Geoware</B></A>.

<LI> <B>UNIX or LINUX:</B>
Because of the size of the archives we suggest you verify that you have
<A HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/bzip2/index.html" target="_blank">bzip2</A> on your system.
If not, it is worth installing (executables for most platforms are available)
since *.bz2 files are much smaller than *.gz files.  For instance, the
entire GMT package is ~50 Mb with bzip2 and 75 Mb with gzip.

<OL>
<LI><I>Automated install [Recommended]</I>.
Obtain and install GMT by interacting with the <A HREF="gmt_install_form.html">INSTALL FORM</A>.
Follow instructions there to obtain the Bourne shell install-script <I>and</I> a customized install
parameter file.  The automated install will also install netCDF if needed.
<LI><I>Manual install</I>.
If you prefer, you can also do the typical manual install by ftping the files, untar,
run configure, make etc.  Read the README file for the required steps.
For manual install you must also manually get and install the <A HREF="ftp://unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf.tar.Z">Unidata
netCDF library</A>, version 3.4 or higher, which GMT requries.
For your convenience, the source code is available from the GMT ftp sites.

<LI><I>DOS batch files rule</I>.
All the archives are also available as *.zip files.  In addition, two extra files can be found:
GMT_exe.zip contains main GMT executables, and GMT_suppl_exe.zip contains executables for the supplements.
Note that many of the DOS example scripts utilize GNU awk; the WIN32 executable
<A HREF="ftp://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/pub/gmt/gawk303x.zip">gawk</A>
has therefore been placed on all ftp sites.
A precompiled <A HREF="ftp://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/pub/gmt/netcdf-3.5.0_win32bin.zip">netCDF</A>
DLL library for Windows is also available, and needed for GMT to compile and run (even if you only get the executables).

<LI><I>DOS batch files suck, part I</I>.
Because you cannot get much done with DOS batch jobs, we strongly recommend that you install
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin" target="_blank">Cygwin</A>, a free UNIX emulation package for Windows.
Cygwin lets you open shell windows and access
standard UNIX tools such as tcsh, gcc, etc.  You would then install GMT as described above for UNIX/Linux.
<LI><I>DOS batch files suck, part II</I>.
If you run Windows, you can get access to csh command windows by installing the freely available
Windows<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/sfu" target="_blank"> Services for UNIX</A>, a UNIX environment
for Windows. SFU lets you install GMT as described for UNIX/Linux above.
<LI><I>DOS batch files suck, part III</I>.
Finally, you may consider the option of purchasing and installing <A HREF="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMWare</A>, a virtual
computer which allows you to install numerous operating systems (such as Linux) and then pursue the
general Linux/UNIX install option above within your virtual machine.

<LI> <B>OS/2: </B>
GMT has been ported to OS/2.  For information and precompiled executables, see Allen Cogbill's
<A HREF="http://internet.cybermesa.com/~acogbill/gmt/gmt4os2.html target="_blank"">GMT OS/2 page</A>.

<LI><I>Running MacOS X or MacOS X Server</I>.
GMT installs and runs under MacOS X which is UNIX-based (follow instructions for
UNIX/Linux in 1.1).  You must have installed the Developer Tools (the GNU compiler,
etc; these are not installed by default but packages are available on the CDs or
from Apple support site. User-friendly GMT packages are also available via 
<A HREF="http://fink.sourceforge.org" target="_blank">Fink</A>.
<LI><I>Running Linux</I>.
If you run Linux (MkLinux, Yellowdog, etc) on your (old) Mac, follow the steps above for
automatic install under UNIX or LINUX (1.1).
<LI><I>Running MacOS 9</I>.
GMT does not run directly under MacOS 9 or earlier.  However, you can run GMT
using the commercial <A HREF="http://www.tenon.com/products/machten" target="_blank">Machten</A>
UNIX emulation package.  When Machten is installed, GMT can be installed as under 1.1 above.
