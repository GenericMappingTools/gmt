4.5.6 scripts should be fully backward compatible with 4.5.5.  For a list of all the new

capabilities and enhancements, see the <A HREF="gmt_releases.html">RELEASES</A>

<HR>
<H3><CENTER>20-SEPT-2009: GMT Version 4.5.1 Released</H3></CENTER>

<HR>
<H3><CENTER>15-JUL-2009: GMT Version 4.5.0 Released</H3></CENTER>
4.5.0 scripts are for the most part fully backward compatible with 4.4.0.  One
exception is the modifier :<I>radius</I>[unit] to the <B>-G</B> option in grdcontour for
the placement of contour labels.  This is now +r<I>radius</I>[unit] since the
colon interfered poorly with ddd:mm:ss coordinates.  Also, we have now made -180/+180
the default output range for geographic coordinates (it used to be 0-360).  You can change
this by editing the OUTPUT_DEGREE_FORMAT setting.  For a list of all the new
capabilities and enhancements, see the <A HREF="gmt_releases.html">RELEASES</A>
page.
<HR>
<H3><CENTER>15-FEB-2009: GMT Version 4.4.0 Released</H3></CENTER>
4.4.0 scripts are for the most part fully backward compatible with 4.3.1.  One
exception is the map scale option <B>-L</B> in psbasemap and pscoast which
had difficulties parsing ddd:mm:ss coordinates in the presence of the optional
:label: modifier.  Also, we have now made -180/+180 the default annotation range
for geographic maps (it used to be 0-360).  You can change this by editing the
PLOT_DEGREE_FORMAT setting.  For a list of all the new
capabilities and enhancements, see the <A HREF="gmt_releases.html">RELEASES</A>

3.4 scripts should be backward compatible with 3.3.6 except for
one minor feature:  Because we have extended the number of possible
DEGREE_FORMAT options to 12, users must now add 100 (not 10 as before)
to choose the big degree symbol.  As most users are hardly aware of
that option it should not cause much uproar(?).
<HR>
<H3><CENTER>17-OCT-2000: GMT Version 3.3.6 Released</H3></CENTER>
3.3.6 scripts should be backward compatible with 3.3.5
<HR>
<H3><CENTER>21-JUL-2000: GMT Version 3.3.5 Released</H3></CENTER>
<HR><P>
3.3.5 scripts should be backward compatible with 3.3.4, with the
following potential exceptions:
<UL>
<LI>The function <B>STEP</b> in gmtmath has been renamed <B>STEPT</b>
to be compatible in function to <b>STEPX</b> and <b>STEPY</b> in grdmath.
A new function <b>STEP</b> has been added to gmtmath (and grdmath) that
simply takes the Heaviside function of the current stack entries.
<LI>The common option -: is now processed in the generic i/o functions
and not in individual programs.  The fact that -: was only intended to
apply to geographical data is now enforced.  Thus, if you used -: in
imaginative ways on non-geographic data you will have to consider
changes to those scripts.
</UL>

Going from GMT version 3.2 to 3.3 there were several minor syntax
changes that renders GMT 3.3 slightly incompatible with 3.2.
The following is a list of known incompatibilies (please report
others if you find any; we may have missed some):
<OL>
<LI>grdproject.c: The -F option now toggles the node registration
of the output file.  This change was necessary since the old
version would write out a node-registred grid regardless what
the input grid was, unless -F was set.  The new policy will
use the same registration as the input unless -F is set.
</OL>
<HR>
<H3><CENTER>19-MAR-1999: GMT Version 3.2 Released</H3></CENTER>
<HR><P>
Going from GMT version 3.1 to 3.2 there were several minor syntax
changes that renders GMT 3.2 slightly imcompatible with 3.1.
The following is a list of known incompatibilies (please report
others if you find any; we may have missed some):
<OL>
<LI>makecpt.c: Due to the much more flexible version in 3.2 (with
many choices of different cpt master tables there are several
changes.  The old options -C, -M, -S have been replaced by
-Tz0/z1/dz. and -I (reversing the colors) have been added.

<LI>pslib.c: This change only affects programmers that link their
own code with -lpsl.  The arguments to ps_plotinit has changed
so that instead of passing paper_width as a double we pass a
2-element integer array with paper width and height in points.
See the pslib man page for details.

3.1.1 scripts should be backward compatible with 3.1

<HR><P>
Going from GMT version 3.0 to 3.1 there were several minor syntax
changes that renders GMT 3.1 slightly imcompatible with 3.0.
The following is a list of known incompatibilies:
<OL>
<LI>grdclip.c: -A and -B have been replaced by -Sa and -Sb; the -B
    interferred with the usual meaning of -B.

<LI>grdpaste.c: Same problem; introduced -Sa and -Sb.

<LI>grdview.c: -D no longer an option; -M and -W follow grdcontour
    syntax and are set by -Wc and -Wm instead.

<LI>nearneighbor.c: -M is replaced by -Sradius[k] as in psmask.

<LI>psmask.c: -S and -C have reversed roles to match psclip; -M is
    replaced by -Sradius[k] as in nearneighbor.

<LI>project.c: -M becomes the multisegment flag as usual; old -M is
    replaced by -Q.

<LI>psclip.c: -S becomes -C, and -O must now explicitly be set.

<LI>psxy[z].c: -L only needed to close polygons; -W[pen] determines
    symbol outlines.

<LI>No programs have the old option -F to change the color of the map
    frame.  This is now done via gmtset BASEMAP_FRAME_RGB r/g/b.
    
<LI>-GP|p now takes pattern dpi, not building block size.  A dpi setting
    of 0 still gives the resolution implied by DOTS_PR_INCH.

<LI>psscale now uses the machinery of the common -B option for anotations.
    This means that the x-label goes beneath the scale and the y-label can
    be used as a unit label.  The title string :.title: is no longer used.

<LI>grd2xyz.c and xyz2grd.c.  Please note that -Z and -b are incompatible
    and are NOT to be used at the same time (your i/o cannot both have 1
    and 3 columns...).

<LI>pscoast.c.  -A changed from -A<area>/<maxlevel> (with <min_level> implicitly
set to 0) to -A<area>/<min_level>/<maxlevel>.  If you used -A to exclude
higher levels you need to explicitly include the 0 for min_level

</OL>
In addition, there are changes that ARE backward compatible but you are 
encouraged to change your script to follow the new syntax:
<OL>
<LI>sample1d.c:  Old options -A, -C, -L are now set via -Fa, -Fc, -Fl,
    but the old options are still silently recognized.  As these may go
    away in the future we suggest you adopt to the new order.
</OL>
