# INSTRUCTIONS TO USERS:
#
# 1. Copy 'ConfigUserTemplate.cmake' to 'ConfigUser.cmake' and make any edits
#    related to install directory, the whereabouts of GSHHS, DCW.
# 2. If you are an advanced user who wishes to tinker with the more advanced
#    settings, then copy 'ConfigUserAdvancedTemplate.cmake' to 'ConfigUserAdvanced.cmake',
#    explore and make changes to your ConfigUserAdvanced.cmake file
#    to override variables in 'ConfigDefault.cmake' on a per-user basis.
# 3. Follow the rest of the installation instructions in BUILDING.md.
#
# 'ConfigUser.cmake' and 'ConfigUserAdvanced.cmake' are not version controlled
# (currently listed in .gitignore).
#
# Note: CMake considers an empty string, "FALSE", "OFF", "NO", or any string
# ending in "-NOTFOUND" to be false (this happens to be case-insensitive, so
# "False", "off", "no", and "something-NotFound" are all false).  Other values
# are true.  Thus it does not matter whether you use TRUE and FALSE, ON and
# OFF, or YES and NO for your booleans.

## Section 1: Installation paths
##
# Set install name suffix used for directories and gmt executables [undefined]:
#set (GMT_INSTALL_NAME_SUFFIX "suffix")

# Install into traditional directory structure. Disable to install a
# distribution type directory structure (doc and share separated) [on]:
#set (GMT_INSTALL_TRADITIONAL_FOLDERNAMES OFF)

# installation paths are relative to ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} unless absolute
# path is given.
# ============================================================================

## Section 3: GMT features

## Section 4: Advanced tweaking
##

#
# Testing and development
#

# Enable running examples/tests with "ctest" or "make check" (out-of-source).
# Need to set either DO_EXAMPLES, DO_TESTS or both and uncomment the following
# line.
#enable_testing()
#set (DO_EXAMPLES TRUE)
#set (DO_TESTS TRUE)
#set (DO_ANIMATIONS TRUE)
# Number of parallel test jobs with "make check":
#set (N_TEST_JOBS 4)

# Enable this option to run GMT programs from within ${GMT_BINARY_DIR} without
# installing or setting GMT_SHAREDIR and GMT_USERDIR first. This is required
# for testing [OFF]:
#set (SUPPORT_EXEC_IN_BINARY_DIR ON)

# Uncomment the following line to enable running low-level C tests of the API
#set (DO_API_TESTS ON)

# List extra sub-dirs of 'src' with a CMakeLists.txt to build custom modules
# that link against the full gmt libs. (For building codes that only need the GMT API,
# see the https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/custom-supplements project).
# These supplemental modules can be built into seperate libraries.
#set (SUPPL_EXTRA_DIRS newsuppl1 newsuppl2 ...)

# Directory in which to install the release sources per default
# [${GMT_BINARY_DIR}/gmt-${GMT_PACKAGE_VERSION}]:
#set (GMT_RELEASE_PREFIX "release-src-prefix")

# If set to false, image conversion from PS images to PNG and PDF does
# not depend on the gmt binary target. Note: "make gmt" is then required
# before docs_depends [TRUE].
#set (GMT_DOCS_DEPEND_ON_GMT FALSE)

#
# Debugging
#

# Set build type can be: empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo or MinSizeRel [Release]:
#set (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)

# Extra debugging for developers:
#if ( CMAKE_GENERATOR STREQUAL "Xcode" )
#   #	So Xcode can find the supplemental plug-ins during debug sessions
#	add_definitions(-DXCODER)			# Handle a debug plugin directory
#	add_definitions(-DDEBUG_MODERN)			# To set PPID == 0 during Xcode test
#	message("Add Xcode definition for GMT")
#endif()
# Uncomment these two statements if you are a developer debugging GMT:
#add_definitions(-DDEBUG)
#add_definitions(-DMEMDEBUG) # Turn on memory tracking see gmt_support.c for extra info
#add_definitions(-DUSE_COMMON_LONG_OPTIONS) 	# Turn on testing of upcoming long-option syntax for common GMT options
#add_definitions(-DUSE_MODULE_LONG_OPTIONS) 	# Turn on testing of upcoming long-option syntax for module options
#set (CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-Wall -Wdeclaration-after-statement ${CMAKE_C_FLAGS}") # recommended even for release build

#else (HAVE_OPENMP)
#	set (CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE "-ggdb3 -O2 -Wuninitialized")  # check uninitialized variables
#endif (HAVE_OPENMP)

#
# System specific tweaks
#

# This is for GCC on Solaris to avoid "relocations remain against allocatable
# but non-writable sections" problems:
#set (USER_GMTLIB_LINK_FLAGS -mimpure-text)

# This may be needed to enable strdup and extended math functions with GCC and
# Suncc on Solaris:
#set (CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -D__EXTENSIONS__")

# Do not warn when building with Windows SDK or Visual Studio Express:
#set (CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS ON)

# Manually select runtime library when compiling with Windows SDK or Visual
# Studio Express:
#set (CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS c:/Windows/System32/msvcr100.dll)

# If your NetCDF library is static (not recommended, applies to Windows only)
#set (NETCDF_STATIC TRUE)

# If want to rename the DLLs to something else than the default (e.g. to
# append the bitness - Windows only)
# WARNING: if using this option it is mandatory that the suffix starts with an underscore.
#if (WIN32)
# set (BITAGE 32)
# # Detect if we are building a 32 or 64 bits version
# if (CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
#   set (BITAGE 64)
# endif ()
# set (GMT_DLL_RENAME gmt_w${BITAGE})
# set (PSL_DLL_RENAME psl_w${BITAGE})
# set (SUPP_DLL_RENAME supplements_w${BITAGE})
#endif(WIN32)

# On Windows Visual C 2012 needs _ALLOW_KEYWORD_MACROS to build
#if(MSVC11)
#  add_definitions(/D_ALLOW_KEYWORD_MACROS)
#endif(MSVC11)
