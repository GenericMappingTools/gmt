# There are three configuration files:
#   1) "ConfigDefault.cmake" - is version controlled and used to add new default
#      variables and set defaults for everyone.
#   2) "ConfigUser.cmake" - is not version controlled (currently listed in
#      .gitignore) and used to override basic defaults on a per-user basis.
#   3) "ConfigUserAdvanced.cmake" - is not version controlled (currently listed in
#      .gitignore) and used to override advanced defaults on a per-user basis.
#
# NOTE: If you want to change CMake behaviour just for yourself,
#       copy "ConfigUserTemplate.cmake" to "ConfigUser.cmake" and then edit
#       "ConfigUser.cmake" for basic settings. For advanced settings,
#       copy "ConfigUserAdvancedTemplate.cmake" to "ConfigUserAdvanced.cmake" and edit it.

# You can set the build configuration type as a command-line argument to 'cmake' using -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug for example.
# If no build configuration type was given as a command-line option to 'cmake' then a default cache entry is set here.
# A cache entry is what appears in the 'CMakeCache.txt' file that CMake generates - you can edit that file directly or use the CMake GUI to edit it.
# The user can then set this parameter via the CMake GUI before generating the native build system.
# NOTE: this is not needed for visual studio because it has multiple configurations in the ide (and CMake includes them all).
# however makefile generators can only have one build type (to have multiple build types you'll need multiple out-of-place builds - one for each build type).
#
# The following are some valid build configuration types:
# 1) Debug - no optimisation with debug info.
# 2) Release - release build optimised for speed.
# 3) RelWithDebInfo - release build optimised for speed with debug info.
# 4) MinSizeRel - release build optimised for size.

# already set, don't set it."
