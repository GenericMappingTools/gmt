\section{Preface to version 3.3.7 (February--2001)} 
Version 3.3.7 is yet another service release with
several bug fixes.  However, there are also (once again) a few enhancements
driven by bug reports as well as a few enhancements driven
by the developers' research needs.  Soon, we expect
to release the stable release series 3.4 (and subsequent releases
3.4.x) as well as initiate a developers' release 3.5 (where new features
will be tested before they are incorporated into a future stable release
series 3.6).  This release marks the first release that is under CVS control as
previously the GMT project was maintained using SCCS on a Sun workstation.

\subsection{Major bug fixes in 3.3.7}

We continue to converge asymptotically toward a stable release
as both old and new problems are brought to our attention.
Table~\ref{tbl:3.3.6bugs} lists the most
significant corrections; for a full description see the
\filename{CHANGES} file in the main \GMT\ directory.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}  \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\emph{File}}	& \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\emph{Bug}} \\ \hline
gmt\_map.c	&	Only had forward, but not inverse projection of linear \\
		&	geographic data.  Messed up the \Opt{JX}<width>d inverse. \\
		&	No Gnomonic annotations except for rectangular box. \\
		&	Ensure that if BOTH west/east are < 0, add 360. \\
		&	Really densely sampled lines could fail to generate \\
		&	a crossing at map boundary due to imposed round-off. \\
		&	Now enforce that all lines start with "pen down". \\ \hline
gmt\_plot.c	&	No longer overrides \texttt{GMT\_set\_format} for anotations. \\ \hline
gmt\_shore.c	&	Needed to reset node-levels when some polygons are skipped with \Opt{A}. \\ \hline
gmt\_support.c	&	Had error in verifying xinc for boundary condition prep. \\

\subsection{Minor changes in 3.3.6}

%We have also added
%one new supplemental program to the {\bf misc} package.  The program is
%called \GMTprog{gmtdigitize} and it interfaces with a digitizing tablet via
%a serial port.  It digitizes points from maps and applies the relevant inverse
%map projection.  It has only been tested with a Calcomp DrawingBoard III from
%Linux but we expect it to port easily to other configurations.

There were some bad links in the \filename{gmt\_man.html} module that have been fixed.
A few enhancements in individual program functionality have also occured:

\begin{description}

\item [grdvector.c] \Opt{Sf} now sets fixed length vectors.

\end{table}

\subsection{Minor changes in 3.3.6}

The install script for this version has been rewritten for the Bourne shell.
This should allow the simplified installation process to be more portable than
the previous C shell version.

Several more binary netcdf formats have been added to \GMT.  The new formats have ids in
the 7--11 range for netcdf files with byte, char, short, int, and double arrays which complement the
default floats.  Our thanks goes to Masakazu Higaki, JMA for implementing this feature.
We have added the GSHHS data extractor programs to the supplemental archive.
This supplement (gshhs) extracts coastline polygons from the GSHHS data base which
forms the basis for the \GMT\ coastline data.  The binary GSHHS data files
must be obtained separately from NGDC or SOEST as before.
%We have also added
%one new supplemental program to the {\bf misc} package.  The program is
%called \GMTprog{gmtdigitize} and it interfaces with a digitizing tablet via
%a serial port.  It digitizes points from maps and applies the relevant inverse
%map projection.  It has only been tested with a Calcomp DrawingBoard III from
%Linux but we expect it to port easily to other configurations.

A few enhancements in individual program functionality have also occured:

\begin{description}

\item [gmt\_support.c] Allow custom formatting of axis values via {\bf D\_FORMAT} when
this parameter does \emph{not} contain the 'g' format type.

\item [gmtmath] Added new logical operators {\bf LT, LE, EQ, GE, GT, ISNAN} and {\bf NAN}, as well as functions
{\bf XOR, MODE, MAD, LMSSCL, TDIST, FDIST, CHIDIST, INT, SUM, UPPER} and  {\bf LOWER}.
Added plain \Opt{T} for data with no time column, \Opt{Cr} to toggle active columns, and \Opt{S} to report
just the first row of the results.

\item [grdcontour] Added \Opt{D-} to get short DOS names that would work with WIN32 \progname{gawk}.

\item [grdmath] Added the same functions as for \GMTprog{gmtmath}, with the expection of functions
{\bf INT} and {\bf SUM}; we also added the operator {\bf EXTREMA}.

\item [imgsrc/img2grd]	New Bourne script that calls \GMTprog{img2mercgrd} and optionally converts
the Mercatorized grid to geographic using \GMTprog{grdproject}.

\section{Preface to version 3.3.5 (July--2000)} 
Version 3.3.5 is another service release with
several bug fixes.  However, there are also (once again) a few enhancements
driven by bug reports as well as a few enhancements driven
by the developers' research needs.  Later this year, we expect
to release the stable release series 3.4 (and subsequent releases
3.4.x) as well as initiate a developers' release 3.5 (where new features
will be tested before they are incorporated into a future stable release
series 3.6).

\subsection{Minor changes in 3.3.5}

This version has new political border files (\filename{binned\_border\_?.cdf})
that include the borders inside former Yugoslavia.  We have also added many
more special characters in the reencoding of the fonts; Appendix F shows the new
symbols.  A new defaults parameter, {\bf ANOT\_MIN\_SPACING}, has been added to
control how close anotations may be plotted to each other.  The existing parameter
{\bf OBLIQUE\_ANOTATION} has been extended to contain numerous bit-flags that
give users more control over how anotations for oblique map projections are
handled.  Furthermore, by adding 10 to the {\bf DEGREE\_FORMAT} parameter you
can access the large degree symbol for map annotations [Default is the standard,
 small ring symbol].  The processing of the \Opt{:} flag is now taking place inside
the generic input routines instead of in each program module, as is the check for
periodicity in longitudes.  This improves consistency and ensures that \Opt{:} is
only applied to geographic coordinates.
%We have also added
%one new supplemental program to the {\bf misc} package.  The program is
%called \GMTprog{gmtdigitize} and it interfaces with a digitizing tablet via
%a serial port.  It digitizes points from maps and applies the relevant inverse
%map projection.  It has only been tested with a Calcomp DrawingBoard III from
%Linux but we expect it to port easily to other configurations.

A few enhancements in individual program functionality have also occured:

\begin{description}

\item [\Opt{JS}] The stereographic projection can now take \Opt{Js}{\it lon/lat/lats/1:xxxx}
for true scale at the specified standard parallel.

\item [block*] Option \Opt{L} indicates that x is longitude and subject to 360-degree periodicities.

\item [gmtmath] Renamed {\bf STEP} to {\bf STEPT} to be consistent with the naming in \GMTprog{grdmath}.
Added new function {\bf STEP} that simply applies the Heaviside function to the stack values.

\item [gmtselect] Option \Opt{L} (no arguments) indicates that x is longitude and subject to 360-degree periodicities.

\item [grd2xyz] Option \Opt{Sr} suppresses all non-NaN nodes (complements \Opt{S} which suppresses all NaN nodes).

\item [grdfilter] Added \Opt{T} to toggle registration as in \GMTprog{grdsample}, but
left old \Opt{N} in there (undocumented) to ensure backward compatibility.

\item [grdmath] Added new function {\bf STEP} that applies the Heaviside function to the stack values.

\item [grdtrack] Added \Opt{Z} option to only write the $z$-column.  Option \Opt{L} (no arguments) indicates that
x is longitude and subject to 360-degree periodicities.

\item [nearneighbor] Option \Opt{L} (no arguments) indicates that x is longitude and subject to 360-degree periodicities.

\item [pstext]	Added \Opt{Dj} to set ``smart'' offsets that go in the
direction of the text string's justification.

\item [psxy, psxyz]	\Opt{Sf} is now a general front plotter, with several types of
fronts available.  The new option is backwards compatible with 3.3.4 and earlier versions.

\item [splitxyz] Option \Opt{L} indicates that x is longitude and subject to 360-degree periodicities.

\item [surface] Option \Opt{L} indicates that x is longitude and subject to 360-degree periodicities.

\item [trend2d] Option \Opt{L} indicates that x is longitude (so \Opt{:} may be processed correctly).

\item [triangulate] Option \Opt{L} indicates that x is longitude and subject to 360-degree periodicities.

\item [xyz2grd]	Added \Opt{A}[n$|$z] option to count or add up multiple node entries.

\item [dbase/grdraster.c]	Now, \Opt{G}{\it gridfile} is optional; if not given we write
xyz triplets to stdout instead.

\item [mex]	We have added a configure script to this package so that the entire install,
including supplement, can be done in the background.

\item [xgrid/xgridedit.c]	We have added a configure script to this package to deal properly
with the required X libraries, as well as using the GMT library for reading and writing grid files.

\section{Preface to version 3.3.4 (March--2000)} 
Version 3.3.4 is once again predominantly a service release with
several bug fixes.  However, there are also (once again) a few enhancements
driven by bug reports as well as a few enhancements driven
by the developers' research needs.

\subsection{Major bug fixes in 3.3.4}

We continue to converge asymptotically toward a stable release
as both old and new problems are brought to our attention.
Table~\ref{tbl:3.3.3bugs} lists the most
significant corrections; for a full description see the

		&	Error in \texttt{GMT\_merc\_inverse} caused \GMTprog{grdproject} to exceed array \\
		&	bounds for some common situations and dump core. \\
		&	Added a better map-crossing locator for ellipsoidal borders. \\

\subsection{Minor changes in 3.3.4}

Because the support for NFS under Linux in pre-2.4 versions of the kernel is
incomplete, we have added the \-\-disable-flock option to the configure script
which will disable history file locking.  This should only be necessary to use
if your Linux machine is using NFS-mounted external disks from other \UNIX\
workstations.  Also, because many 3.0 users have been utterly confused by the fact
that \GMT\ now (since 3.1) produces freeform \PS\ output by default, we have added
a \-\-enable-eps option so that users may change the default to Encapsulated
\PS\ (Confused users should really read the PAPER\_MEDIA section in the \GMTprog{gmtdefaults}
man page).  Furthermore, \progname{gmtinstall.bat} and \progname{gmtsuppl.bat} now produce Win32 executables
that use DLL libraries.  Finally, two general changes affect almost all of the \GMT\ programs:

\begin{enumerate}

\item ASCII input data using the dd:mm[:ss] format are now accepted.
These geographic coordinates, as well as regular decimal or integer
representations, may optinally have one of W, E, S, N (or w, e, s, n) as
a suffix to indicate the sign of the coordinate.  For example, 12:30:15W,
33.5s, and 45:03:15.5666N are all valid input data strings (note there can
be no spaces between the number and the suffix).  The same
formats are also understood by any \GMT\ command-line option that
expects coordinates (e.g., \Opt{R}, \Opt{J}, and others, except \Opt{B}
since \GMT\ has always used the colon character (:) to 
indicate the beginning and end of axis label and title character strings.

\item The polar (cylindrical) projection has been enhanced to
accept a modifier ({\bf a}) which makes \GMT\ expect clockwise-oriented
azimuths (\Opt{Jpa} or \Opt{JPa}) rather than the default counter-clockwise
directions (\Opt{Jp} or \Opt{JP}).

\end{enumerate}

A few enhancements in individual program functionality have also occured:

\begin{description}

\item  [gmtmath/grdmath] now have two more functions (RAND and NRAND) that create
uniform deviates $(0 < x < 1)$ and normal deviates (zero mean and unit variance),
respectively.

\item [grdproject] Added option \Opt{C} as in \GMTprog{mapproject} to set origin
independently of \Opt{M}, which now allows the units to be cm, inch, or meter.
Also added option \Opt{A} which behaves similarly to option \Opt{F} in \GMTprog{mapproject},
allowing for a 1:1 scaling in specified units.

\item [grdimage] For \Opt{T}, cpt file can give shade as - (to skip this slice) or
as a pattern fill.

\item [grdmask] Added \Opt{L} to mean that input values are geographical coordinates subject
to 360 degree periodicities.

\item [grdview] For \Opt{Qs}, cpt file can give shade as - (to skip this slice) or
as a pattern fill.

\item [psscale] now paints polygons instead of an image when the cpt file is discrete
and no illumination effects (\Opt{I}) have been selected.  This ensures that the
color scale will print the expected colors on some confused color printers; it
also reduced the size of the \PS\ output in those cases.  Finally, pattern fills
are allowed in the cpt file.

\item [psbasemap] The option \Opt{G} can now take patterns.

\item [pscontour] Now paints only those pieces of a triangle that are not to be
skipped (old version always painted each triangle).

\item [psxy/psxyz] New symbol (\Opt{Sw}) added to draw pie wedges.

\end{description}

Finally, some changes have taken place in the supplemental packages:

\begin{description}

\item [cps/*.c] A new library (\progname{libuu}) provide internal \progname{uuencode}
and \progname{uudecode} capability (and hence works under WIN32).  Because of this,
the package now only requires \progname{bzip2} to be installed.  Added option \Opt{x} to
\GMTprog{cpsencode} to allow it to embed executable files encountered (these are by
default skipped).  \GMTprog{cpsdecode} now sets the file permissions correctly, and
the special flag \#CPS: (Win32 use REM CPS: ) can take wild card notations.  Both
programs also have new option \Opt{n} which shows what the program would do without
actually embedding or extracting files.

\item [meca/*.c] several bug fixes have been incorporated, see
meca/ERRATA for details.

\item [mgg/gmttrack.c] All \PS\ output is now written via \GMTprog{pslib} functions.

\item  [spotter/backtracker] has new option \Opt{A} to limit output to certain
times or stages, \Opt{LF} or \Opt{LB} will return stage pole id rather than the
predicted ages, \Opt{S} to write tracks to individual files, while \Opt{C} allows
us to read finite rotation poles instead of stage poles.

\item [spotter/hotspotter] also have \Opt{C} to allow
us to read finite rotation poles instead of stage poles.

\item [spotter/originator] is a new program to the SPOTTER package which
associates each seamount with the most likely hotspot based on flowline analysis.

\item [x\_system] is the old suite of programs that \progname{x2sys} eventually
will replace completely.  In the interim, we will provide it under the \GMT\
supplements; all tools have been brought up to POSIX/ANSI-C standards.

\end{description}

\section{Preface to version 3.3.3 (December--1999)} 

We released \GMT\ 3.3.3 with two objectives in mind:
First, it fixes all bugs that were reported and temporarily
dealt with in the Errata sheet on the web page, and second,
it (finally) simplifies the install process by using a
\filename{configure} script created by GNU \progname{autoconf}.
Running \filename{configure} as part of the installation
removes the guessing that we resorted to earlier when assembling
\filename{gmt\_math.h}.  \filename{configure} will create the
file \filename{gmt\_notposix.h} from \filename{gmt\_notposix.h.in}
and this system-specific file is then included by \filename{gmt\_math.h}.
Settings specific to non-\UNIX\ operating systems such as Microsoft
Windows and OS/2 have been consolidated in \filename{gmt\_notunix.h}.
Other installation parameters, however,
remain under user control as they reflect choices that are either
philosophical or imply additional functionality of particular
compilers.  Users can now assemble answers to such questions from
the install form on the main \GMT\ web page and give the resulting
file as argument to the \progname{install\_gmt} script, resulting
in a non-interactive, batch-type installation process.  However, the
script can also be run interactively, as in earlier versions.  Finally,
we have decided to rename the lib directory: from now on it will be
called share.  There is also a new top-level Makefile that handles
the entire installation.

\subsection{Major bug fixes in 3.3.3}

Since \GMT\ 3.3.2 was released in September 1999, a few 
bugs were quickly brought to our attention by alert users.
The most severe of these are listed in Table~\ref{tbl:3.3.2bugs} and
have been fixed in the current release.  For a complete listing see
the \filename{CHANGES} file in the main \GMT\ directory.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Bugs in \gmt\ version 3.3.2}
\label{tbl:3.3.2bugs}
\end{table}

\subsection{Minor changes in 3.3.3}
A few enhancements in functionality have also occured:

\begin{description}

\item  [blockmean] was given a new option \Opt{S} to report the
sum of $z$-values inside a block rather than their average [Default].

\item [grdimage] has a new option \Opt{T} which will plot an image
without any interpolation.  This is useful for categorical data where
interpolation is undefined.

\item [grdinfo] was given a new option \Opt{F} to report the
domain and increment in world mapping format.

\item [grdview] has the same new \Opt{T} option as \GMTprog{grdimage}.

\item [psimage] was given new options \Opt{E} to specify image resolution
in dots pr inch (instead of image size), and \Opt{F} to draw a rectangular
frame around the image.

\item [psxy/psxyz] can accept an optional \%{\it font} appended to the \Opt{Sl}
option which will select a particular font [Default is the anotation font].
The program will now also accept the \Opt{C} option with 
multisegment polygon files (\Opt{M}).  Then, polygon colors are assigned
by looking for a \Opt{Z}{\it val} string in each multisegment header; this
{\it val} is then used to select the color via cpt lookup.

\end{description}

Finally, four Japanese font names were added to the list of fonts that
\GMT\ recognizes (see Appendix F).  However, like all other fonts, you need to have
the fonts installed on your system or printer to actually use them.

\section{Preface to version 3.3.2 (September--1999)} 

\GMT\ 3.3.2 was released to address
several annoying bugs that inadvertently were introduced in \GMT\ 3.3.1.
At the same time we have made minor changes to how \GMT\ is 
installed.  To ensure that the \GMT\ archives only contain
files that are either in the public domain or released under the GNU Public License,
we have reverted back to our earlier practice of letting Dave
Watson's Delaunay triangulation routine be the default,
while the much faster implementation of John Shewchuck can be selected
as an option.  Shewchuck's files are also pulled out of the main \GMT\ archive
and are now distributed as a separate archive (the updated \progname{install\_gmt} script
are cognizant of these changes).

We have also changed the way \GMT\ deals with SI and US default values.
In previous releases, one could choose SI or US at compile time, and
that would select what default values \GMT\ would use when the user
had no \filename{.gmtdefaults} file.  This implies that the \GMT\ executables behave
slightly different for SI and US.  In order to have only one set of
executables, we have made the SI/US selection a run-time feature.
Thus, one can switch back and forth at anytime.  The \GMT\ Default
(SI or US) is kept in the file \filename{gmt.conf} in the lib subdirectory and
determines what defaults are used. 

\subsection{Major bug fixes in 3.3.2}

Since \GMT\ 3.3.1 was released in early July 1999, a few dumb
coding errors were caught by alert users.
The most severe of these are listed in Table~\ref{tbl:3.3.1bugs} and
have been fixed in the current release.  For a complete listing see
the \filename{CHANGES} file in the main \GMT\ directory.

gmt\_cdf.c	&	Same. \\ \hline
gmt\_map.c	&	Fixed incorrect clippath for \Opt{JP} projection. \\ \hline
gmt\_support.c	&	Incorrectly resampled cpt files when \GMTprog{makecpt} \Opt{I} was used. \\ \hline

\subsection{Minor changes in 3.3.2}

A few minor coding enhancements and simplifications have also
been taken care of in this release.  They are summarized in
Table~\ref{tbl:3.3.2minor}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}  \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\emph{File}}	& \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\emph{Bug}} \\ \hline
gmt\_init.c	&	Now checks for \filename{gmt.conf} to initialize \GMT\ default values. \\
		&	Binary stdin/stdout should now work under Windows. \\ \hline
gmt\_map.c	&	Added HALF\_DBL\_MAX to avoid overflow in subtractions. \\

gmt\_plot.c	&	Now always resets pen dashing in \texttt{GMT\_setpen}. \\ \hline
gmt\_stat.c	&	Added inverse error function for \GMTprog{gmtmath} and \GMTprog{grdmath}. \\ \hline
gmt\_support.c	&	Added function to deal with optional file \filename{coastline.conf} containing \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Minor improvements in \gmt\ version 3.3.2}
\label{tbl:3.3.2minor}
\end{table}

\subsection{Coastlines in 3.3.2}

Node level information for the crude coastline data were found to be
incorrect, in particular near Antarctica.  Thus, the \filename{binned\_GSHHS\_c.cdf}
file has been updated.  This problem only seemed to affect the output of
\GMTprog{grdlandmask} and \GMTprog{gmtselect}.  No other coastline changes have taken place.

\section{Preface to version 3.3.1 (July--1999)} 

Unlike \GMT\ 3.3, 3.3.1 really is a service-release taking care of
some annoying bugs that were introduced in \GMT\ 3.2 and 3.3.
However, it does also provide several new or improved services
under the \GMT\ supplemental archive.

\subsection{Major bug fixes in 3.3.1}
   Since \GMT\ 3.3 was released in early June 1999, several dumb
mistakes were caught by alert users.
The most severe of these are listed in Table~\ref{tbl:3.3bugs}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}  \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\emph{File}}	& \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\emph{Bug}} \\ \hline
gmt\_map.c	&	Mindless insistance on $|y| \leq 90$ applied even for  \\
		&	non-geographic data in gridlines. \\
		&	Left-right conic boundary x-value routines not implemented. \\ \hline
gmt\_stat.c	&	PLM in \GMTprog{grdmath} and \GMTprog{gmtmath} had bug in loop over $m$. \\ \hline
gmt\_support.c	&	CPT files with gray-value columns only did not \\
		&	get processed correctly (e.g. example 04). \\ \hline
grdview.c	&	\Opt{Qs} messed up Fore- and Back-ground colors. \\ \hline
pstext.c	&	\Opt{M} with a single-line paragraph gave \PS\ error. \\ \hline
psxy.c		&	Needed a ``stroke'' operator after drawing error bars. \\
		&	\Opt{E} with no symbols gave SEGV.  Now, \Opt{E} with no xy \\
		&	is taken to mean \Opt{Exy} (or \Opt{Eyx}, when \Opt{:} is set). \\ \hline
psxy[z].c	&	\Opt{SV}[]n{\it norm} did not work, now fixed. \\
		&	\Opt{SE} would scale axes incorrectly if MEASURE\_UNIT $\neq$ INCH. \\ \hline
xyz2grd.c	&	When \Opt{S} was set the fopen modes were not set to \\
		&	rb and wb and hence i/o would fail under WIN32. \\ \hline
\Opt{Js}	&	A new implementation of the stereographic projection \\
		&	fixes a problem with optimizing code under WIN32. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Bugs in \gmt\ version 3.3}
\label{tbl:3.3bugs}
\end{table}

\subsection{Minor changes in 3.3.1}

A few minor coding enhancements and simplifications have also
been taken care of in this release.  They are summarized in
Table~\ref{tbl:3.3.1minor}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}  \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\emph{File}}	& \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\emph{Bug}} \\ \hline
psxy[z].man	&	Clarified that \Opt{N} does not affect the PostScript \\
		&	BoundingBox; you may have to post-process in order \\
		&	to get a correct BB if data is plotted outside \Opt{R}. \\ \hline
pstext.man	&	Same. \\ \hline
gmt\_init.c	&	Use GMT\_DEFAULT\_PATH instead of /usr/local/gmt. This \\
		&	is set in makegmt.macros (via \progname{install\_gmt}) and makes \\
		&	installation more flexible by removing hardwired paths. \\ \hline
pslib.c		&	Same. \\ \hline
gmt\_cdf.c	&	Reduced repeated code and simplified subset operations. \\ \hline
gmt\_customio.c	&	Same. \\ \hline
gmt\_grdio.c	&	Same.  Combined, these 3 shrank in size by 30\% \\ \hline
pstext.c	&	Better treatment of European font reencodeing by letting \\
		&	the \PS\ interpreter keep track of what fonts have \\
		&	been reencoded already. \\ \hline
gmt\_stat.c	&	Faster implementation of kei, ker, bei, ber, which now \\
		&	can be evaluated beyond $|x| = 8$. \\ \hline
*.c *.h		&	Added MSC support for DLL libraries (WIN32). This has \\
		&	reduced the size of the *.zip binary archive alot. \\ \hline
Makefile	&	Now includes support for building shared libraries \\
		&	under \UNIX.  A few parameters have been added to \\
		&	\filename{makegmt.macros} (values are obtained by \progname{install\_gmt}). \\ \hline
fourt.c		&	Included \filename{sunmath.h} instead of prototype for sincos. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Minor improvements in \gmt\ version 3.3.1}
\label{tbl:3.3.1minor}
\end{table}

\subsection{New features in 3.3.1}

Only one enhancements has found its way into \GMT\ 3.3.1.  This applies to
the \Opt{B} option.  In addition to an axis label, each axis may also set
a unit label to be appended to each individual anotation on that axis.
This is useful if you want anotations to be, say, 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, etc.
The syntax is :,``unit label'': (note the comma flag).  Like for labels, the
quotes are only needed if the unit label has spaces in it.  Normally,
a single space is inserted between anotation value and unit.  This
may be removed by letting the unit begin with - (the minus sign).
The unit option is only used with non-geographic projections.

\subsection{Supplemental archive in 3.3.1}

The supplemental archive has undergone many significant changes:

\begin{description}

\item [dbase:]	Added optional final column to the \filename{grdraster.info}
	database that can be set to L or B to indicate the endianness of the
	binary data file.  A missing column means the data has the same
	endianness as the machine and no swapping is needed.

\item [meca:]	 The meca package comes with completely new tools for plotting
	 symbols of importance to seismologiest and geodesists.  The
	 package now has two new tools (\GMTprog{pscoupe} and \GMTprog{pspolar}),
	 while the old \textbf{psvelomeca} has been separated into \GMTprog{psmeca}
	 and \GMTprog{psvelo}.

\item [mgg:]	 The MGD77 reader \GMTprog{mgd77togmt} is now aware of the new
	Y2K-compliant MGD77 format and also will make a reasonable effort
	 in handling older files.

\item [spotter:] New package with two tools for plate tectonic reconstructions:
	 \GMTprog{backtracker} will move geological markers forward or backward
	 in time, while \GMTprog{hotspotter} will apply the hotspotting technique
	 to make a CVA image of potential hotspot locations.  An announcement
	 will shortly be published in EOS Trans. AGU.

\item [x2sys:]	 A new implementation of Wessel's crossover error estimation
	 tool, which now is POSIX, ANSI-C, and Y2K complient, as well as
	 faster.  The package is generic and can extract data from arbitrary ASCII
	 or binary data files with \GMTprog{x2sys\_datalist} and calculate crossovers
	 from the same files with \GMTprog{x2sys\_cross}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Coastlines in 3.3.1}

Two lake polygons have been merged into one larger lake, other
than that, no changes have taken place.  However, we have rearranged how
we supply the data: Now, the archives GMT\_lib.tar, GMT\_high.tar,
and GMT\_full.tar will contain the directory lib, rather than GMT3.x/lib.
This simplifies upgrades since these files rarely change between releases.
The latest version of \progname{install\_gmt} knows about these changes.

\section{Preface to version 3.3 (June--1999)} 

\GMT\ 3.3 is for the most part a service-release taking care of some
annoying bugs and typos, but it also provides significant new features.
For that reason we have decided to increment the minor version number
instead of issuing the anticipated 3.2.1 release.  We plan to
port the archiving of \GMT\ from SCCS to CVS which will make the maintanence
of multiple revisions more managable in the future.

\subsection{Major bug fixes in 3.3}
Since \GMT\ 3.2 was released in late March 1999, several dumb mistakes were caught
by alert users.  The most severe of these are listed in Table~\ref{tbl:3.2bugs}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}  \hline

\subsection{New features in 3.3}

Despite what we said when releasing \GMT\ 3.2, a few enhancements have
found their way into \GMT\ 3.3.  These are:

\begin{description}

\item [Projections:]	We have added three new projections: The equidistant
conic (\Opt{JD}), Van der Grinten (\Opt{JV}), and Eckert IV (\Opt{JKf}).\footnote{The
introduction of Eckert IV means that the existing Eckert VI 
projection should be selected as \Opt{JKs}, although \Opt{JK} will work for
backwards compatibility.}

\item [pstext.c:]	Added typesetting of whole paragraphs (\Opt{M}).

\item [gmtmath.c:]	Added the standard \Opt{H} option, and the function {\bf DILOG}.

\item [grdmath.c:]	Added the function {\bf DILOG}.

\item [pslib.c:]	Added \texttt{ps\_imagemask} for transparent bitmaps,
\texttt{ps\_words} for paragraph typesetting, and
\texttt{ps\_flush} for buffer flushing.

\item [gmt\_support.c:]	Understands that fore- or background color in \Opt{Gp} can be
-- which means transparency.

\item [psimage.c:]	\Opt{Gf}-- or \Opt{Gb}-- means transparency.

\item [grdimage.c:]	New \Opt{G}[{\bf f}|{\bf b}]{\it rgb} option to make transparent
color masks from otherwise black/white 1-bit images.

\item [pscontour.c:]	Added \Opt{A}-- to force deactivation of all contour labels.

\item [grdcontour.c:]	Same.

\item [sample1d.c:]	Handles \Opt{N} file that spans the range of
several \Opt{M} segments.

\item [grdreformat.c:]	Now skips comments in the \filename{gmtformats.d} file.

\item [gmtmath.c:]	Added \Opt{Q} shorthand option for scalar math.

\item [pscoast.c:]	Added \Opt{bo} option for use with \Opt{M}.

\item [gmtselect.c:]	Added \Opt{Cf} for using (fast) Flat earth rather
than (slow) great circle distance calculations.

\item [xyz2grd.c:]	Added \Opt{S}[{\it file}] option to simply swap the
byte order and write out new table.  Added H and I for unsigned short and ints.
\Opt{L} and xyz input will now enforce grid periodicity.

\item [grd2xyz.c:]	Added H and I for unsigned short and ints.

\end{description}

\section{Preface to version 3.2 (March--1999)} 

Since the official release of \GMT\ in EOS (GMT 3.1.1) we have continued to
fix reported bugs.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point
of view) a bug is sometimes a ``feature'' and to fix it we need to change \GMT\
in such a way that it becomes incompatible with earlier versions.  Also,
a need for a new feature arises and gets implemented by the \GMT\ developers.
In \GMT\ 3.2, all these things have happened\footnote{As we get smarter about
working on multiple revisions we anticipate to do a better job of separating
bug fix upgrades from new features.}.  Because of the many changes we have
decided to call this release 3.2.

\subsection{Major bug fixes in 3.2}
Several bugs where quickly discovered in \GMT\ 3.1.1; the most serious are
listed in Table~\ref{tbl:3.1bugs}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}  \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\emph{File}}	& \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\emph{Bug}} \\ \hline

		&	Incorrectly read Sun rasterfiles made on bigendian machines \\ \hline
img2mercgrd.c	&	\Opt{T}0 gave 0 data \\ \hline
gmt\_customio.c	&	Incorrectly read/wrote Sun rasterfiles on bigendian machines \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Bugs in \gmt\ version 3.1.1}
\label{tbl:3.1bugs}
\end{table}


\subsection{New features in 3.2}

We have added many new and significant features in this version.
Many of these have long been anticipated by the user community:

\begin{description}

\item [Paper Media Selection:]
We have added support for paper media formats in \filename{.gmtdefaults}.
PAPER\_WIDTH have been replaced by PAPER\_MEDIA which can be set
to one of $\sim$30 different media like A4, Letter, Legal, etc.
Append -- for Manual Feed, and + for EPS file format.
Usage is discussed in the \GMTprog{gmtdefaults} man and web pages.

\item [Pattern Files:]
Programs reading rasters can now read Run Length Encoded Sun rasterfiles.
\filename{gmthex2ras.c} is obsolete since Sun rasters are supposed to be
read/written at the 1-byte level, thus avoiding big/little endian troubles
(this was what \filename{gmthex2ras.c} was supposed to deal with).

\item [Explicit Unit Specification:]
All options that specifies lengths or sizes can now have a unit-modifier
appended that explicitly sets the length unit.  This allows users to write
unit-independent \GMT\ scripts that will function correctly regardless of
what the MEASURE\_UNIT parameter is set to.  E.g., \Opt{JM}6 can give a map that
is 6 cm, 6 inches, or 6 meters wide depending on MEASURE\_UNIT, while
\Opt{JM}6{\bf i} will \emph{always} give a 6 inch map.  The unit-modifiers allowed are
{\bf c} (cm), {\bf i} (inch), {\bf m} (meter), and {\bf p} (point).
All \GMT\ example scripts have been edited to use this mechanism.
A related issue is that all internal \GMT\ functions expects pens to be
in points, not dpi units.  You may still specify pens in dpi units, but
\GMT\ will convert to points and update \filename{.gmtdefaults} using points.

\item [Absolute Positioning with --X --Y:]
By prepending ``a'' to the {\textit {x}} and {\textit {y}} offsets you can now get
absolute rather than the [default] relative shifts of coordinate origin.
For example, \Opt{Xa}4{\bf i} \Opt{Ya}4{\bf i} will temporarily move the origin (4,4) inches,
then reset to (0,0) after plotting.
[Default leaves the origin at (4,4), and subsequent \Opt{X} \Opt{Y} are now relative
to that origin, not the original (0,0).

\item [New Geospatial Filtering Option:]
\GMTprog{gmtselect} has new switch \Opt{N} for checking if points are inside/outside
geographical features (coastlines, so one may also set \Opt{A} \Opt{D} as in
\GMTprog{pscoast} and \GMTprog{grdlandmask}).

\item [New RPN Calculator for Table Data:]
The new program \GMTprog{gmtmath} is a ``Reverse Polish Notation'' calculator that will
create or operate on table data; it thus complements \GMTprog{grdmath}.
It is much simpler and faster than \progname{awk} for calculations on tables.

\item [New Operators for \GMTprog{gmtmath} (23) and \GMTprog{grdmath} (26):]
New functions include {\bf KEI, KER, BEI, BER} (Kelvin-Bessel functions
or order 0), {\bf LOG1P}, {\bf POP} (delete stack entry), {\bf PLM}
(Associated Legendre polynomials), {\bf I0, I1, IN, K0, K1, KN} (modified
Bessel functions), {\bf ERF} and {\bf ERCF} (error functions), {\bf YLM}
(fully normalized surface spherical harmonics), and {\bf STEP} (Heaviside
step function).  In addition, you can use the
Bessel functions {\bf J0, J1, JN, Y0, Y1, YN} if your system supports them
(The \progname{gmt\_math\_init} script(s) will find out and add them to \filename{gmt\_math.h}).  Finally, in \GMTprog{grdmath} we have added the
operators {\bf DDX} ($\partial/\partial x$), {\bf DDY} ($\partial/\partial y$), {\bf D2DX2} ($\partial^2/\partial x^2$), {\bf D2DY2}
($\partial^2/\partial y^2$), and {\bf CURV} ($\nabla^2$), and in
\GMTprog{gmtmath} we have {\bf DDT} ($d/dt$) and {\bf D2DT2}
($d^2/d t^2$).

\item [ZapfDingbats added to \GMT\ Fonts:]
Since it is present in most modern \PS\ laserwriters we have
added ZapfDingbats to the list of build-in \GMT\ fonts, making
a total of 35 fonts.  Appendix F shows the new symbols.

\item [Binary i/o with \Opt{M}:]
If the \Opt{M} and \Opt{b} options are used together, \GMT\ will look for
multisegment headers in binary files which are defined as records where all
fields equal NaN.  Any flags passed to \Opt{M} are ignored.

\item [Improved \GMTprog{makecpt} and \GMTprog{grd2cpt}:]
These programs now have built-in knowledge of about a dozen or so standard
color tables that the user may choose from.  You can also use an existing
cpt file as the starting point.  It is now simpler than ever to make
various color tables other than the default rainbow map.

\item [All Documentation in both \PS\ and HTML Format:]
All \GMT\ documentation (including the toturial) have been rewritten in
\LaTeX, thus facilitating translations to \PS\ and HTML
web pages with GIF illustrations.   For the first time, the documentation
comes with an index, and has undergone modest changes in contents.

For more details see the \filename{CHANGES} file. 
Because all documentation has changed completely,
while coastlines have not, and the source code is pretty
small anywat, there are no patch files.  You must reinstall
the entire package, except you do not need to copy the
*\_lib.tar file or the
optional high and full-resolution coastlines since they
have not changed.
New users should simply get the latest \progname{install\_gmt}
script which will get the most recent tar files of all the packages.

\section{Preface to version 3.1 (November--1998)} 

\GMT\ 3.1 is a major upgrade of the Generic Mapping Tools.
However, most of the improvements are ``under the hood'',
not readily visible to the user.  The primary purpose of the
present release is to ensure complete portability of \GMT\ to
as many hardware platforms as possible.  To accomplish that
goal we made three fundamental changes to the \GMT\ source code: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item{All \GMT\ source code strictly follows the ANSI C standard.} 

\item{All \GMT\ source code is POSIX compliant.} 

\item{Architecture-independent files are read and written with netCDF 3.}

\end{enumerate} 

Since the release of \GMT\ 3.0 we have seen more 64-bit operating
systems and a steady evolution of netCDF to accomodate such
systems.  \GMT\ 3.0 has therefore become harder and harder to
install and it was time for a significant upgrade.  \GMT\ 3.1 is
now highly portable and has been installed and tested under
Solaris, HP Unix, SGI Irix, Linux, MkLinuk, OSF, Ultrix, and
Win32.  The \GMT\ package also is Y2K compliant.
 
	Although portability has been our main concern, \GMT\ 3.1 also
delivers several new features and programs.  Among the most
significant offerings are: 
\index{GMT@\GMT!v3.1!new features}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Two new map projections (Gnomonic and Miller).} 

\item{90 built-in bit and hachure patterns and a new mechanism
for color patterns.  \Opt{Gp}$|${\bf P} now accepts pattern {\it dpi}
rather than block building {\it size}; {\it dpi} = 0 uses default dpi.} 

\item{Full support for native binary table input/output for all
programs that read tables.} 

\item{Shorthand mechanism for 5 alternative 2-D grid formats via
\filename{.gmt\_io} file.} 

\item{Four new programs: \GMTprog{blockmode} for block-averaging by mode
estimates, \GMTprog{gmtconvert} to translate between native binary and
ASCII table formats, \GMTprog{gmtselect} to select subsets of table data
based on multiple spatial criteria, and \GMTprog{grdvolume} for calculating
volumes under surfaces within a specified contour.  One supplemental
program, \GMTprog{psimage}, has been revised and incorporated into the
main \GMT\ while another, \GMTprog{psmegaplot}, has been relegated to the
supplemental archive.} 

\item{Boundary condition options for several grid-generating or
manipulating programs.} 

\item{Improved \PS\ BoundingBox implementation.} 

\item{Numerous bug fixes (see \filename{CHANGES} for deltails).} 

\item{More examples (for a total of 20).} 

\item{A new \GMT\ map-making tutorial book and short-course.}

\end{enumerate}

In addition, several programs have more functionality thanks to
new options.  For example, \GMTprog{pscoast} can now set up clip paths
based on the coastlines or dump an ASCII table rather than drawing
them, and \GMTprog{psxy} and \GMTprog{psxyz} can read symbol codes from
the input data.  The following is a summary of new capabilities:

Speaking of \GMTprog{pscoast}, the coastline and political boundaries data
bases have undergone modest changes and will continue to do so as we
obtain better data.  Several bugs have been fixed, and new political
borders have been added (but not all).

	While fixing inconsistencies and enhancing the \GMT\ programs we do
occasionally get into a situation which was best resolved by renaming
a command line option.  We do not like to do so since it introduces
incompatibilities between versions of \GMT; however, sometimes this
is neccesary in order to fix a bug (as in \GMTprog{grdclip} and
\GMTprog{grdpaste} below).  This has in particular been used to ensure
that the common command line options are unique and that some others
have the same meaning in as many programs as possible.  Table~\ref{tbl:3.0_to_3.1.arrrghh} is a
list of incompatibilities between \GMT\ 3.0 and 3.1, revise any \GMT\
shell scripts accordingly.

\end{table}
In addition, no programs have the old option \Opt{F} to change the
color of the map frame.  We did this to free up this option for future
enhancements since the effect easily can be obtained via \GMTprog{gmtset}
BASEMAP\_FRAME\_RGB r/g/b.

We have received many bug reports regarding \GMT\ 3.0 and we have
attempted to correct as many problems as we have had time for.
Some of you may be disappointed in finding that \GMT\ 3.1 still has
a bug you reported to us.  Part of our difficulty lies in the fact
that \GMT\ 3.1 has changed significantly since 3.0 so that it is not
always easy to verify that a problem has been fixed or is still
with us.  Thus, while not bug-free, \GMT\ 3.1 provides a more stable
platform allowing easier verification and termination of bugs.
We encourage you to discover (or rediscover) bugs and bring them to
our attention.

Finally, we would like to thank those of you who continue to
contributed ideas, bug reports, and advice since version 3.0.  We
appreciate your input, and believe version 3.1 reflects many of
the suggestions you have provided.

\section{Preface to version 3.0 (October--1995)}

As of January 1995 it appears that around 5000 scientists
and engineers worldwide are using \GMT\ in their work.  This estimate
is based on ftp traffic over the last few years. Most users of \GMT\
are geoscientists, but there are apparently no limits to the kind
of applications that may benefit from \GMT:  We know \GMT\ is used
in medical research, engineering, physics, mathematics, social
and biological sciences, and by geographers, fisheries institutes,
oil companies, and a wide range of government agencies.

\begin{figure}
\epsfig{figure=eps/GMT_usage_3.0.eps}
\caption[Subset of all \gmt\ users obtained by an electronic survey
in October 1994]{A subset of all \gmt\ users obtained by an electronic survey
in October 1994.  The circles represent approximately 200 separate
institutions with more than 1600 \gmt\ users combined.} 
\end{figure}

The present version 3.0 represents a significant improvement over
earlier releases.  The most visible change is the inclusion of a
high-resolution coastline data base which will allow the generation
of small-scale, detailed maps of high quality and accuracy (see
Appendix K for more details).  In addition, we have added three
more map projections, six new programs, modified and added new
options to others, and killed numerous bugs.  The file \filename{CHANGES} on
the tar archive has all the details; here are some highlights: \\
\index{GMT@\GMT!v3.0 enhancements|(}

\noindent
$\bullet$ Customizable grdfile i/o. \\

\noindent
This allows the user to supply his/her own read/write kernels,
link these with \GMT\ during installation, and be able to use \GMT\
programs directly with the users data files.  This mechanism also
speeds up many operations by letting the user select a format that
allows piping instead of saving the results of intermediate steps
to temporary files (as is necessary with the netCDF format).  In
addition to the default netCDF-based gridfile format, \GMT\ comes
equipped with 3 additional formats:

\begin{description} 

\item[-]{binary 4-byte floating points with leading grdheader (See Appendix B for formats)} 

\item[-]{binary 2-byte short integers with leading grdheader} 

\item[-]{Sun 8-bit standard rasterfile (colormap ignored)} 

\end{description} 

\noindent
The file \filename{gmt\_customio.c} contains information on
how to add more formats.  We anticipate that formats of general
interest will be developed by enterprising users and forwarded
to us for possible inclusion in later \GMT\ releases. \\ 

\noindent
$\bullet$ Binary i/o option for several i/o intensive programs. \\

\noindent
Several programs typically read and/or write large amounts of
data  These include \GMTprog{blockmean}, \GMTprog{blockmedian},
\GMTprog{grd2xyz}, \GMTprog{nearneighbor}, \GMTprog{splitxyz}, \GMTprog{surface}, and \GMTprog{xyz2grd}.  These programs are
often used to decimate vast quantities of data, but much of the
processing time can be spent on the ASCII-binary conversion
during read and write. A new \Opt{b} option allows these
programs to do their i/o in native binary format (single or
double precision). \\ 

\noindent
$\bullet$ 4+ new map projections. \\

\noindent
We have included the Robinson pseudo-cylindrical projection
(adopted by the National Geographic Society), the Eckert VI
equal area projection, the Plate Carr\'{e}e equidistant
cylindrical projection, and a generic cylindrical equal area
projection.  The latter accepts an arbitrary standard latitude:
Set to 0\DS, 30\DS, 37.4\DS, or 45\DS\ you obtain the Lambert,
Behrmann, Trystan-Edwards, and Peters (Gall) cylindrical
projections, respectively.  Furthermore, we have generalized
the sinusoidal projection.  The interrupted map on the cover
page is a superposition of three sinusoidal plots that are
offset horizontally. \\ 

\noindent
$\bullet$ 6 new programs. \\

\noindent
Programs have been added to address several important tasks:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\emph{Program}}	& \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\emph{Task}} \\ \hline
grd2cpt		&	Creates a color palette table based on a grdfile \\ \hline
grdlandmask	&	Creates ``wet-dry'' mask grdfile from shoreline data base \\ \hline
grdreformat	&	Converts between various grid formats \\ \hline
grdvector	&	Draws vector field plots for gridded files \\ \hline
pscontour	&	Contouring of raw xyz data (by triangulation) \\ \hline
triangulate	&	Optimal Delaunay triangulation and gridding of xyz-data \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{New programs in \gmt\ 3.0}
\end{table}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\noindent
$\bullet$ Simpler map projection option \Opt{J*}. \\

\noindent
All projections may now be specified with upper or lower case
modifier {\bf *}: Lower case works as before (it expects map
\emph{scale}), while upper case expects map \emph{width}.
This makes it much easier to fit a plot on the page.  E.g.,
\Opt{Jm}5 will generate a Mercator map in which 1\DS\ of
longitude equals 5 inches (or cm, depending on your choice of
units), while \Opt{JM}5 will make a map that is 5 inches
(or cm) wide regardless of region selected (in both cases,
the height will of course depend on region).

All projections now accept arbitrary regions in the \Opt{R}
option (in earlier versions there were some projections that
implicitly assumed a global map \Opt{R}0/360/-90/90). \\ 

\noindent
$\bullet$ Improved syntax checking. \\

\noindent
All \GMT\ programs now have extensive syntax checking and give
shorter and more meaningful error messages.  It is only when
no arguments are provided that the entire usage message will
be echoed. \\ 

\noindent
$\bullet$ Better SI support \\

\noindent
During installation of \GMT\ you may choose to use SI units as
your default (basically, it means that plot sizes are measured
in cm instead of inch).  This will modify the source code to
show the SI default values and produce man pages using SI units.
However, you can always override the defaults by modifying your
\filename{.gmtdefaults} file. \\ 

\noindent
$\bullet$ Operational changes. \\

\noindent
A few modifications of command arguments have taken place.
If you have developed shell-scripts with \GMT\ commands you
may need to edit these accordingly:

\begin{description}

\item[-]{The \Opt{\#} option (for multiple plot copies) has
been replaced by \Opt{c} to avoid problems in cshell scripts
(\# is the start of a comment in cshells).} 

\item[-]{The optional r suffix in \Opt{J} has been moved to
the \Opt{R} option.} 

\item[-]{\GMTprog{grdmath} is now a general-purpose ``Reverse Polish
Notation'' (RPN) calculator for grd-files.  Hence, the order of
the arguments is different.} 

\item[-]{The {\it +file} mechanism to read alternative
\filename{.gmtcommands} files has been changed to apply to
alternative \filename{.gmtdefaults} files.  This is more
useful since one can now use this mechanism to select different
default settings for different output devices (e.g., slidemakers,
laserwriters, camera-ready journal formats, etc.).} 

\item[-]{2-D interpolations are now done as bicubic or bilinear
interpolation (Taylor expansion is gone).} 

\item[-]{Option \Opt{T} in \GMTprog{grdview} (to smooth contours)
has been renamed \Opt{S} to match the usage in \GMTprog{grdcontour}.} 

\item[-]{\GMTprog{psxy} now clips polygons that exceed the map region correctly.} 

\item[-]{The improved \Opt{U}[/$x_0$/$y_0$/][{\it label}] option now
allows you to specify where you want the timestamp to appear relative
to the lower-left corner of the current plot (not page).  This would
override the default location (-0.75, -0.75) (inches) or (-2,2 cm).} 

\end{description}

\noindent
$\bullet$ Several programs have received additional options. \\

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\emph{Program}}	& \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\emph{Changes}} \\ \hline
grdcontour	&	Added \Opt{M} to create a single multisegment file when using \Opt{D}. \\
		&	\Opt{C} will accept a cpt file if the name ends in ``.cpt'' \\  \hline
grdmath		&	Added hypot, r\_squared, min, and max operators. \\  \hline
nearneighbor	&	Added option \Opt{W} for weighted data input. \\  \hline

\end{tabular} 
\caption{Program changes in \gmt\ 3.0}
\end{table}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The documentation (this book plus all manual pages) has been updated
to reflect these changes.  Two new appendices (J, K) discussing the
finer points of filtering and the development of the high-resolution
coastline data base have been added.

Finally, we would like to thank those of you who have contributed ideas,
bug reports, and advice since version 2.1.  We continue to appreciate
your input, and believe version 3.0 reflects many of the suggestions
you have provided.

\section{Preface to version 2.1 (October--1992)}

Since \GMT\ was announced in EOS in October 1991 we have seen more than
1000 ftp requests for the software, and received about 200 registration
forms.  The large number of new users resulted in many discoveries of
bugs and ``features'' in the programs.  Many of these bugs were fixed
and the tar distribution was updated accordingly, resulting in versions
2.0.1 and 2.0.2.  After the last release (2.0.2), enough modifications
have taken place to warrant the update of the documentation and manual
pages.  In addition to [hopefully] killing most of the bugs, many
programs have been equipped with new features.  The most significant
changes from 2.0 to 2.1 are:

\begin{itemize}
\index{GMT@\GMT!v2.1 enhancements}

\item{More map projections.  We have added the Albers conic equal area,
Cassini cylindrical, Orthographic, Azimuthal equidistant, Hammer equal
area, Interrupted sinusoidal, and Winkler projections, bringing the
number of map projections to 15.} 

\item{3-D plotting.  Most plotting programs will now accept viewpoint
and vertical scale information, making it possible to plot
perspective-view versions of most plots.} 

\item{Coastline data have been reformatted and are now stored using
netCDF.  This improves the portability of \GMT\ and reduces the size
of the distribution archive.} 

\end{itemize}

Specific minor enhancements to individual programs can be found in
the manual pages.  The documentation has been augmented to include
a detailed section on the syntax of each of the map projections,
including examples.  An appendix (C) explaining how to convert \GMT\
\PS\ output to a Macintosh Encapsulated \PS\
File (EPSF) also has been added.

Finally, we would like to thank those of you who have contributed
ideas, bug reports, and advice since the first release.  \GMT\ 2.1
is a much better product than 2.0, but there are still several
shortcomings that we hope to address in future releases.  We are
working on including a high-resolution coastline data base, more
map projections, and time-series capabilities (recognizing misc.
time formats at the data input/output stage, providing time axis
annotation, etc.), just to name a few.  As usual, information
about these improvements will be announced to registered users
by electronic mail.

\section{Preface to version 2.0 (October--1991)}

When \GMT\ was released at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in the
summer of 1988 it quickly became the standard data manipulation
and plotting package which Lamont-Doherty scientists used to
massage data and generate camera-ready maps and diagrams.
Shortly afterwards color capabilities were added, and color maps
and illustrations could easily be viewed under {\it NeWS}
\footnote{{\it NeWS} is a trademark of SUN Microsystems, Inc.} on
the SUN workstations, slides could be shot off the screen, and
screendumps sent to various color hardcopy devices.  Mostly by word
of mouth, the number of \GMT\ users among individuals and institutions
elsewhere grew to include major research centers both in Europe and
the U.S.  The system proved easy to use, was general enough so that
no matter what data you had, it could be manipulated and plotted,
and it produced \PS\footnote{\PS\ is a
trademark of Adobe Systems, Inc.} output which could easily be
edited to include custom enhancements.  By keeping data files in
the ASCII format, most trivial tasks of formatting and processing
would be handled by \UNIX\ utilities such as \progname{awk},
\progname{grep}, \progname{cut}, \progname{paste}, \progname{sed}, etc.

\GMT\ has undergone several modifications since its incarnation more
than three years ago.  The number of map projections available has
doubled and now includes Mercator, Oblique Mercator, UTM,
Stereographic, Lambert's conformal conic, Lambert's azimuthal
equal-area, and Mollweide equal-area projections.  In addition,
non-map projections like log$_{10}$(x) and x$^a$ have been added to
the standard linear projection.

The plotting library {\bf pslib} and the map drawing library
{\bf gmtlib} have been completely rewritten, resulting in higher
quality graphics and more control over details.  The \PS\
macros defined in {\bf pslib} have been optimized, resulting in
smaller output files and shorter execution times.

A major new feature is the concept of the \filename{.gmtdefaults}
file.  In this file, which will reside in the user's home directory,
we find more than 50 parameters including the pen-thicknesses,
font-types, and colors to use for maps, which ellipsoid to employ
in the map projections, and what units to operate in (cm, inch, or
meter).  All of these can be set individually by the user, thus
customizing \GMT\ defaults to produce the desired results without
excessive command line arguments when running individual programs
or having to edit the \PS\ files at a later stage.

In order to make the operation of \GMT\ programs more efficient, the
notion of a command history has been implemented.  The history
remembers the previous standardized command line arguments used
with any \GMT\ program and allows the user to use a shorthand when
the same argument is needed.  This information is stored in a file
called \filename{.gmtcommands} which is maintained in the current
directory.  Thus more than one \filename{.gmtcommands} file can
exist at the same time.

Finally, the format used for storing 2-D gridded data sets has been
changed.  The new format is based on the XDR architecture-independent
data representation as implemented in the netCDF software package
available from NCAR (See Appendix D for how to obtain the necessary
code).  The advantages of using this new format are many; here we
will just mention scanline orientation and the ability to transfer
your binary gridded data sets from one type of computer to another
which may not have the same way of representing floating point numbers.

With all these enhancements, \GMT\ now supports most accepted standards
of today's computing environments: \UNIX, \PS, ASCII
tables, and XDR binary file protocol.  We hope the new version 2.0 of
\GMT\ will enhance your productivity and make data manipulation and
presentation a little bit easier.  Should you have any suggestions to
future enhancements and modification, we would like to hear from you.
