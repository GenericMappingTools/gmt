#		GMT EXAMPLE 03
#
# Purpose:	Resample track data, do spectral analysis, and plot
# GMT modules:	filter1d, fitcircle, gmtconvert, gmtinfo, project, sample1d
# GMT modules:	spectrum1d, trend1d, pshistogram, psxy, pstext
# Unix progs:	echo, rm
#
# This example begins with data files "ship_03.txt" and "sat_03.txt" which
# are measurements of a quantity "g" (a "gravity anomaly" which is an
# anomalous increase or decrease in the magnitude of the acceleration
# of gravity at sea level).  g is measured at a sequence of points "x,y"
# which in this case are "longitude,latitude".  The "sat_03.txt" data were
# obtained by a satellite and the sequence of points lies almost along
# a great circle.  The "ship_03.txt" data were obtained by a ship which
# tried to follow the satellite's path but deviated from it in places.
# Thus the two data sets are not measured at the same of points,
# and we use various GMT tools to facilitate their comparison.
# The main illustration (example_03.ps) are accompanied with 5 support
# plots (03a-f) showing data distributions and various intermediate steps.
#
# First, we use "gmt fitcircle" to find the parameters of a great circle
# most closely fitting the x,y points in "sat_03.txt":
#
ps=example_03.ps
gmt set GMT_FFT kiss
cpos=`gmt fitcircle @sat_03.txt -L2 -Fm --IO_COL_SEPARATOR=/`
ppos=`gmt fitcircle @sat_03.txt -L2 -Fn --IO_COL_SEPARATOR=/`
#
# Now we use "gmt project" to project the data in both sat_03.txt and ship_03.txt
# into data.pg, where g is the same and p is the oblique longitude around
# the great circle.  We use -Q to get the p distance in kilometers, and -S
# to sort the output into increasing p values.
#
gmt project  @sat_03.txt -C$cpos -T$ppos -S -Fpz -Q > sat.pg
gmt project @ship_03.txt -C$cpos -T$ppos -S -Fpz -Q > ship.pg
#
# The gmtinfo utility will report the minimum and maximum values for all columns. 
# We use this information first with a large -I value to find the appropriate -R
# to use to plot the .pg data. 
#
R=`gmt info -I100/25 sat.pg ship.pg`

#
# From this plot we see that the ship data have some "spikes" and also greatly
# differ from the satellite data at a point about p ~= +250 km, where both of
# them show a very large anomaly.
#
# To facilitate comparison of the two with a cross-spectral analysis using "gmt spectrum1d",
# we resample both data sets at intervals of 1 km.  First we find out how the data are
# typically spaced using gmtmath DIFF to get the delta-p between points and view it with 
# "gmt pshistogram".
#
gmt math ship.pg -T -i0 DIFF = | gmt pshistogram  -W0.1 -Gblack \
	-JX3i -K -X2i -Y1.5i -B0 -B+t"Ship" -U"Example 3b in Cookbook"+o-1.75i/-1.25i \
	> example_03b.ps
gmt math sat.pg -T -i0 DIFF = | gmt pshistogram  -W0.1 -Gblack \
	-JX3i -O -X5i -B0 -B+t"Sat" >> example_03b.ps
#
# This experience shows that the satellite values are spaced fairly evenly, with
# delta-p between 3.222 and 3.418.  The ship values are spaced quite unevenly, with
# delta-p between 0.095 and 9.017.  This means that when we want 1 km even sampling,
# we can use "gmt sample1d" to interpolate the sat data, but the same procedure applied
# to the ship data could alias information at shorter wavelengths.  So we have to use
# "gmt filter1d" to resample the ship data.  Also, since we observed spikes in the ship
# data, we use a median filter to clean up the ship values.  We will want to use "paste"
# to put the two sampled data sets together, so they must start and end at the same
# point, without NaNs.  So we want to get a starting and ending point which works for
# both of them.  This is a job for gmt info -L -Af.
#
bounds=`gmt info ship.pg sat.pg -I1 -Af -L -C -i0  --IO_COL_SEPARATOR=/`
#
# Now we can use $bounds in gmt math to make a sampling points file for gmt sample1d:
gmt math -T$bounds/1 -N1/0 T = samp.x
#
# Now we can resample the gmt projected satellite data:
#
gmt sample1d sat.pg -Tsamp.x > samp_sat.pg
#
# For reasons above, we use gmt filter1d to pre-treat the ship data.  We also need to sample
# it because of the gaps > 1 km we found.  So we use gmt filter1d | gmt sample1d.  We also
# use the -E on gmt filter1d to use the data all the way out to bounds :
#
gmt filter1d ship.pg -Fm1 -T$bounds/1 -E | gmt sample1d -Tsamp.x > samp_ship.pg
#
# Now we plot them again to see if we have done the right thing:
#
gmt psxy $R -JX8i/5i -X2i -Y1.5i -K -Wthick samp_sat.pg \
	-Bxa500f100+l"Distance along great circle" -Bya100f25+l"Gravity anomaly (mGal)" \
	-BWeSn -U"Example 3c in Cookbook"+o-1.75i/-1.25i > example_03c.ps
gmt psxy -R -JX -O -Sp0.03i samp_ship.pg >> example_03c.ps
#
# Now to do the cross-spectra, assuming that the ship is the input and the sat is the output 
# data, we do this:
# 
gmt convert -A samp_ship.pg samp_sat.pg -o1,3 | gmt spectrum1d -S256 -D1 -W -C -T
# 
# Now we want to plot the spectra. The following commands will plot the ship and sat 
# power in one diagram and the coherency on another diagram, both on the same page.  
# We end by adding a map legends and some labels on the plots.
# For that purpose we often use -Jx1i and specify positions in inches directly:

# Now we wonder if removing that large feature at 250 km would make any difference.
# We could throw away a section of data with awk or sed or head and tail, but we
# demonstrate the use of "gmt trend1d" to identify outliers instead.  We will fit a
# straight line to the samp_ship.pg data by an iteratively-reweighted method and
# save the weights on output.  Then we will plot the weights and see how things
# look:
#
gmt trend1d -Fxw -Np1+r samp_ship.pg > samp_ship.xw

#
# From this we see that we might want to throw away values where w < 0.6.  So we try that,
# and this time we also use gmt trend1d to return the residual from the model fit (the 
# de-trended data):
gmt trend1d -Fxrw -Np1+r samp_ship.pg | gmt select -Z0/0.6 -o0,1 -Iz \
	| gmt sample1d -Tsamp.x > samp2_ship.pg
gmt trend1d -Fxrw -Np1+r samp_sat.pg  | gmt select -Z0/0.6 -o0,1 -Iz \
	| gmt sample1d -Tsamp.x > samp2_sat.pg
#
# We plot these to see how they look:

#
# Now we do the cross-spectral analysis again.  Comparing this plot (example_03e.ps) with

# the power in both data sets and reduced the coherency at wavelengths between 20--60 km.
