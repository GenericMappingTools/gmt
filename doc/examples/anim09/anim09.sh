# Animation of a simulated fly-over of the Pacific basin mid-ocean ridge system.
# It uses a premade flight path that originally was derived from a data file
# of the world's ridges, then filtered and manipulated to give the equidistant
# path to simulate a constant velocity at the given altitude, with synthetic
# banking as we turn to follow the path.  We use the 30 arc second global relief
# grid and overlay a few labels for named features.
# DEM:   @earth_relief_30s
# Path:   MOR_PAC_twist_path.txt
# Labels: MOR_names.txt
# We create a global intensity grid using shading from East and a CPT file; these are
# created by the preflight script.
# We add a 1 second fade in and a 1 second fade out for the animation
# The resulting movie was presented at the Fall 2019 AGU meeting in an eLighting talk:
# P. Wessel, 2019, GMT science animations for the masses, Abstract IN21B-11.
# The finished movie is available in our YouTube channel as well (without fading):
# https://youtu.be/LTxlR5LuJ8g
# The movie took ~6 hours to render on a 24-core MacPro 2013.
