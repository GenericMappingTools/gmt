	README file for GMT Examples directory

There are born-again shell (bash) and DOS (bat)
versions of all example scripts.
To run all bash scripts, run do_examples.sh.
To run all bat scripts, run do_examples.bat instead.

Example 27 shows usage of img2grd.  Again, since the user may
not have the img data installed the img2grd call is commented
out and the extracted img grid is supplied.

It is possible that the output you may generate with these
script will differ in subtle ways from the figures shown
in the GMT documentation.  This is most likely caused by
different settings in the gmt.conf file that we used
to generate the plots.

The DOS versions may differ in subtle ways from the UNIX
scripts since DOS is a brain-dead scripting language.  Example
03 is only partly implemented in DOS.  Those who plan to use
the .bat files should seriously ask themselves why they have
not installed cygwin or SFU yet. (See Appendix L for more on
that).
