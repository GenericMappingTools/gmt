## Animation of a spinning Earth showing the crustal ages from EarthByte for the oceans
# and topographic relief on land, with shading given by the global relief and modified
# by position relative to an artificial sun in the east.  A progress slice is added as well.
# We add a 1 second fade in and a 1 second fade out for the animation
# DEM:   @earth_relief_02m.grd
# Ages:   @earth_age_02m.grd
# The resulting movie was presented at the Fall 2019 AGU meeting in an eLighting talk:
# P. Wessel, 2019, GMT science animations for the masses, Abstract IN21B-11.
# The finished movie is available in our YouTube channel as well (without fading):
# https://youtu.be/KfBwQlyjz5w
# The movie took ~2.5 hours to render on a 24-core MacPro 2013.
