.. _-ocols_full:

**-o**\ *cols*\ [,...]
    Select specific data columns for primary output, in arbitrary order. Columns
    not listed will be skipped. Give columns (or column ranges
    in the format *start*\ [:*inc* \]:*stop*, where *inc* defaults to 1 if
    not specified) separated by commas.  Columns may be repeated.
    [Default writes all columns in order].
    Normally, any trailing text in the internal records will be written but
    when **-o** is used you must add the column **t**. Finally, **-on** will
    simply write the numerical output only and skip any trailing text.
