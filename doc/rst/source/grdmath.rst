Description
-----------

**grdmath** will perform operations like add, subtract, multiply, and
hundreds of other operands on one or more grid files or constants using
`Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation>`_
syntax.  Arbitrarily complicated expressions may therefore be evaluated; the
final result is written to an output grid file. Grid operations are
element-by-element, not matrix manipulations. Some operators only
require one operand (see below). If no grid files are used in the
expression then options |-R|, |-I| must be set (and optionally
|SYN_OPT-r|). The expression **=** *outgrid* can occur as many times as
the depth of the stack allows in order to save intermediate results.
Complicated or frequently occurring expressions may be coded as a macro
for future use or stored and recalled via named memory locations.

Required Arguments
------------------

*operand*
    If *operand* can be opened as a file it will be read as a grid file.
    If not a file, it is interpreted as a numerical constant or a
    special symbol (see below).

*outgrid*
    The name of a 2-D grid file that will hold the final result. (See
    :ref:`Grid File Formats <grd_inout_full>`).

Optional Arguments
------------------

.. _-A:

.. |Add_-A| replace:: (|-A| is only relevant to the **LDISTG** operator)
.. include:: explain_-A.rst_

.. _-C:

**-C**\ [*cpt*]
    Retain the grid's default CPT (if it has one), or alternatively replace it with a
    new default *cpt* [Default removes any default CPT from the output grid].

.. _-D:

**-D**\ *resolution*\ [**+f**]
    Selects the resolution of the data set to use with the operator **LDISTG**
    ((**f**)ull, (**h**)igh, (**i**)ntermediate, (**l**)ow, and (**c**)rude). The
    resolution drops off by 80% between data sets [Default is **l**].
    Append **+f** to automatically select a lower resolution should the one
    requested not be available [abort if not found].

.. _-I:

.. include:: explain_-I.rst_

.. _-M:

**-M**
    By default any derivatives calculated are in z_units/x(or
    y)\_units. However, the user may choose this option to convert dx,dy
    in degrees of longitude,latitude into meters using a flat Earth
    approximation, so that gradients are in z_units/meter.

.. _-N:

**-N**
    Turn off strict domain match checking when multiple grids are
    manipulated [Default will insist that each grid domain is within
    :math:`10^{-4}` times the grid spacing of the domain of the first grid listed].

.. |Add_-R| replace:: |Add_-R_links|
.. include:: explain_-R.rst_
    :start-after: **Syntax**
    :end-before: **Description**

.. _-S:

**-S**
    Reduce (i.e., collapse) the entire stack to a single grid by applying the
    next operator to all co-registered nodes across the entire stack.  You
    must specify |-S| *after* listing all of your grids.  **Note**: You can only
    follow |-S| with a reducing operator, i.e., from the list **ADD**, **AND**, **MAD**,
    **LMSSCL**, **MAX**, **MEAN**, **MEDIAN**, **MIN**, **MODE**, **MUL**, **RMS**,
    **STD**, **SUB**, **VAR** or **XOR**.

.. |Add_-V| replace:: |Add_-V_links|
.. include:: explain_-V.rst_
    :start-after: **Syntax**
    :end-before: **Description**

.. include:: explain_-aspatial.rst_

.. |Add_-bi| replace:: The binary input option
    only applies to the data files needed by operators **LDIST**,
    **PDIST**, and **INSIDE**.
.. include:: explain_-bi.rst_

.. |Add_-di| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code

Notes On Operators
------------------

#. For Cartesian grids the operators **MEAN**, **MEDIAN**, **MODE**,
   **LMSSCL**, **MAD**, **PQUANT**, **RMS**, **STD**, and **VAR** return the
   expected value from the given matrix.  However, for geographic grids
   we perform a spherically weighted calculation where each node value
   is weighted by the geographic area represented by that node.

#. The operator **SDIST** calculates spherical distances in km between the
   (*lon, lat*) point on the stack and all node positions in the grid. The
   grid domain and the (*lon, lat*) point are expected to be in degrees.
   Similarly, the **SAZ** and **SBAZ** operators calculate spherical
   azimuth and back-azimuths in degrees, respectively. The operators
   **LDIST** and **PDIST** compute spherical distances in km if **-fg** is
   set or implied, else they return Cartesian distances. **Note**: If the current
   :term:`PROJ_ELLIPSOID` is ellipsoidal then
   geodesics are used in calculations of distances, which can be slow.
   You can trade speed with accuracy by changing the algorithm used to
   compute the geodesic (see :ref:`PROJ_GEODESIC <Projection Parameters>`).

   The operator **LDISTG** is a version of **LDIST** that operates on the
   GSHHG data. Instead of reading an ASCII file, it directly accesses one of
   the GSHHG data sets as determined by the |-D| and |-A| options.

#. The operator **POINT** reads a ASCII table, computes the mean x and mean
   y values and places these on the stack.  If geographic data then we use
   the mean 3-D vector to determine the mean location.

#. The operator **PLM** calculates the associated Legendre polynomial
   of degree *L* and order *M* (:math:`0 \leq M \leq L)`, and its argument is the sine of
   the latitude. **PLM** is not normalized and includes the Condon-Shortley
   phase :math:`(-1)^M`. **PLMg** is normalized in the way that is most commonly
   used in geophysics. The Condon-Shortley phase can be added by using *-M* as argument.
   **PLM** will overflow at higher degrees, whereas **PLMg** is stable
   until ultra high degrees (at least 3000).

#. The operators **YLM** and **YLMg** calculate normalized spherical
   harmonics for degree *L* and order *M* (:math:`0 \leq M \leq L)` for all positions in
   the grid, which is assumed to be in degrees. **YLM** and **YLMg** return
   two grids, the real (cosine) and imaginary (sine) component of the
   complex spherical harmonic. Use the **POP** operator (and **EXCH**) to
   get rid of one of them, or save both by giving two consecutive = file.nc calls.
   The orthonormalized complex harmonics **YLM** are most commonly used in
   physics and seismology. The square of **YLM** integrates to 1 over a
   sphere. In geophysics, **YLMg** is normalized to produce unit power when
   averaging the cosine and sine terms (separately!) over a sphere (i.e.,
   their squares each integrate to :math:`4 \pi`). The Condon-Shortley phase :math:`(-1)^M`
   is not included in **YLM** or **YLMg**, but it can be added by using *-M*
   as argument.

#. All the derivatives are based on central finite differences, with
   natural boundary conditions, and are Cartesian derivatives.

#. Files that have the same names as some operators, e.g., **ADD**,
   **SIGN**, **=**, etc. should be identified by prepending the current
   directory (i.e., ./LOG).

#. Piping of files is not allowed.

#. The stack depth limit is hard-wired to 100.

#. All functions expecting a positive radius (e.g., **LOG**, **KEI**,
   etc.) are passed the absolute value of their argument. (9) The bitwise
   operators (**BITAND**, **BITLEFT**, **BITNOT**, **BITOR**, **BITRIGHT**,
   **BITTEST**, and **BITXOR**) convert a grid's single precision values to
   unsigned 32-bit ints to perform the bitwise operations. Consequently,
   the largest whole integer value that can be stored in a float grid is
   2^24 or 16,777,216. Any higher result will be masked to fit in the lower
   24 bits.  Thus, bit operations are effectively limited to 24 bit.  All
   bitwise operators return NaN if given NaN arguments or bit-settings <= 0.

#. When OpenMP support is compiled in, a few operators will take advantage
   of the ability to spread the load onto several cores.  At present, the
   list of such operators is: **LDIST**, **LDIST2**, **PDIST**, **PDIST2**,
   **SAZ**, **SBAZ**, **SDIST**, **YLM**, and **grd_YLMg**.

#. Operators **DEG2KM** and **KM2DEG** are only exact when a spherical Earth
   is selected with :term:`PROJ_ELLIPSOID`.

#. Operator **DOT** normalizes 2-D vectors before the dot-product takes place.
   For 3-D vector they are all unit vectors to begin with.

#. The color-triplet conversion functions (**RGB2HSV**, etc.) includes not
   only *r,g,b* and *h,s,v* triplet conversions, but also *l,a,b* (CIE L a b ) and
   sRGB (*x,y,z*) conversions between all four color spaces.

#. The **DAYNIGHT** operator returns a grid with ones on the side facing the given
   sun location at (A,B).  If the transition width (C) is zero then we get
   either 1 or 0, but if C is nonzero then we approximate the step function
   using an atan-approximation instead.  Thus, the values are never exactly
   0 or 1, but close, and the smaller C the closer we get.

#. The **VPDF** operator expects angles in degrees.

#. The **CUMSUM** operator normally resets the accumulated sums at the end of a
   row or column.  Use Â±3 or Â±4 to have the accumulated sums continue with the
   start of the next row or column.

Macros
------

Users may save their favorite operator combinations as macros via the
file *grdmath.macros* in their current or user (~/.gmt) directory. The file may contain
any number of macros (one per record); comment lines starting with # are
skipped. The format for the macros is **name** = **arg1 arg2 ... arg2**
: *comment* where **name** is how the macro will be used. When this
operator appears on the command line we simply replace it with the
listed argument list. No macro may call another macro. As an example,
the following macro expects three arguments (radius x0 y0) and sets the
nodes that are inside the given Cartesian circle to 1 and those outside to 0:

**INCIRCLE** = **CDIST EXCH DIV** 1 **LE** : usage: r x y INCIRCLE to return 1
inside circle

Marine geophysicist often need to evaluate predicted seafloor depth from an age grid.
One such model is the classic *Parsons and Sclater* [1977] curve.  It may be written

.. math::

    z(t) = \left \{ \begin{array}{rr}
            2500 + 350 \sqrt{t}, & t \leq 70 \\
            6400 - 3200 \exp{\left (\frac{-t}{62.8}\right)}, & t > 20
        \end{array} \right.

A good cross-over age for these curves is 26.2682 Myr. A macro for this system is a bit awkward due to the split but can be written

**PS77** = **STO@T POP** 6400 **RCL@T** 62.8 **DIV NEG EXP** 3200 **MUL SUB RCL@T** 26.2682 **GT MUL** 2500 350 **RCL@T SQRT MUL ADD RCL@T** 26.2682 **LE MUL ADD** : usage: age PS77 returns depth

i.e., we evaluate both expressions and multiply them by 1 or 0 depending where they apply, and then add them.  With this macro
installed you can compute predicted depths in the Pacific northwest via::

    gmt grdmath -R200/240/40/60 @earth_age_01m_g PS77 = depth_ps77.grd

**Note**: Because geographic or time constants may be present in a macro, it
is required that the optional comment flag (:) must be followed by a space.

Examples

.. include:: explain_example.rst_

To compute all distances to north pole, try::

     gmt grdmath -Rg -I1 0 90 SDIST = dist_to_NP.nc

To take :math:`\log_{10}` of the average of 2 files, use::

    gmt grdmath file1.nc file2.nc ADD 0.5 MUL LOG10 = file3.nc

Given the file ages.nc, which holds seafloor ages in m.y., use the
relation depth(in m) = 2500 + 350 \* sqrt (age) to estimate normal seafloor depths, try::

    gmt grdmath ages.nc SQRT 350 MUL 2500 ADD = depths.nc

To find the angle a (in degrees) of the largest principal stress from
the stress tensor given by the three files s_xx.nc s_yy.nc, and
s_xy.nc from the relation tan (2\*a) = 2 \* s_xy / (s_xx - s_yy), use::

    gmt grdmath 2 s_xy.nc MUL s_xx.nc s_yy.nc SUB DIV ATAN 2 DIV = direction.nc

To calculate the fully normalized spherical harmonic of degree 8 and
order 4 on a 1 by 1 degree world map, using the real amplitude 0.4 and
the imaginary amplitude 1.1, use::

    gmt grdmath -R0/360/-90/90 -I1 8 4 YLM 1.1 MUL EXCH 0.4 MUL ADD = harm.nc

To extract the locations of local maxima that exceed 100 mGal in the file faa.nc, use::

    gmt grdmath faa.nc DUP EXTREMA 1 EQ MUL DUP 100 GT MUL 0 NAN = z.nc
    gmt grd2xyz z.nc -s > max.xyz

To demonstrate the use of named variables, consider this radial wave
where we store and recall the normalized radial arguments in radians by::

    gmt grdmath -R0/10/0/10 -I0.25 5 5 CDIST 2 MUL PI MUL 5 DIV STO@r COS @r SIN MUL = wave.nc

To create a dumb file saved as a 32 bits float GeoTIFF using GDAL, run::

    gmt grdmath -Rd -I10 X Y MUL = lixo.tiff=gd:GTiff

To compute distances in km from the line trace.txt for the area represented by the
geographic grid data.grd, run::

    gmt grdmath -Rdata.grd trace.txt LDIST = dist_from_line.grd

To demonstrate the stack-reducing effect of |-S|, we compute the standard deviation
per node of all the grids matching the name model_*.grd using::

    gmt grdmath model_*.grd -S STD = std_of_models.grd

To create a GeoTIFF with resolution 0.5x0.5 degrees with distances in km from the coast line, use::

    gmt grdmath -RNO,IS -Dc -I.5 LDISTG = distance.tif=gd:GTIFF
