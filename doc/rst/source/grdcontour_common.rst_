Description
-----------

**grdcontour** reads a 2-D grid file and produces a contour map by
tracing each contour through the grid. Various options that affect the plotting
are available. Alternatively, the *x, y, z* positions of the contour lines
may be saved to one or more output files (or stdout) and no plot is produced.

Required Arguments
------------------

*grid*
    2-D gridded data set to be contoured. (See GRID FILE FORMATS below).

Optional Arguments
------------------

.. _-A:

**-A**\ [**-**]\ \|\ [*contours*][*labelinfo*]
    *contours* is annotation interval in data units; it is ignored if
    contour levels are given in a file via **-C**. [Default is no annotations]. Prepend
    **-** to disable all annotations implied by **-C**. To just select a few specific
    contours give them as a comma-separated string; if only a single contour please add
    a trailing comma so it is seen as a list and not a contour interval. The optional
    *labelinfo* controls the specifics of the label formatting and consists
    of a concatenated string made up of any of the following control arguments:

.. include:: explain_clabelinfo.rst_

.. _-B:

.. include:: explain_-B.rst_

.. _-C:

**-C**\ *contours*
    The contours to be drawn may be specified in one of four possible ways:

    (1) If *contours* is a string with suffix ".cpt" and can be opened as a
        file, it is assumed to be a CPT. The color
        boundaries are then used as contour levels. If the CPT has
        annotation flags in the last column then those contours will be
        annotated. By default all contours are labeled; use **-A-** to
        disable all annotations.

    (2) If *contours* is a file but not a CPT, it is expected to
        contain contour levels in column 1 and a C(ontour) OR A(nnotate) in
        col 2. The levels marked C (or c) are contoured, the levels marked A
        (or a) are contoured and annotated. Optionally, a third column may
        be present and contain the fixed annotation angle for this contour
        level.

    (3) If *contours* is a string with comma-separated values it is interpreted
        as those specific contours only.  To indicate a single specific contour
        you must append a trailing comma to separate it from a contour interval.
        The **-A** option offers the same list choice so they may be used together
        to plot only specific annotated and non-annotated contours.

    (4) If no argument is given in modern mode then we select the current CPT.

    (5) Otherwise, *contours* is interpreted as a constant contour interval.

    If a file is given and **-T** is set, then only contours marked with
    upper case C or A will have tick-marks. In all cases the contour
    values have the same units as the grid.  Finally, if neither **-C**
    nor **-A** are set then we auto-compute suitable contour and annotation
    intervals from the data range, yielding approximately 10-20 contours.

.. _-D:

**-D**\ *template*
    Dump contours as data line segments; no plotting takes place.
    Append filename template which may contain C-format specifiers.
    If no filename template is given we write all lines to stdout.
    If filename has no specifiers then we write all lines to a single file.
    If a float format (e.g., %6.2f) is found we substitute the contour z-value.
    If an integer format (e.g., %06d) is found we substitute a running segment count.
    If an char format (%c) is found we substitute C or O for closed and open contours.
    The 1-3 specifiers may be combined and appear in any order to produce the
    the desired number of output files (e.g., just %c gives two files, just %f would.
    separate segments into one file per contour level, and %d would write all segments.
    to individual files; see manual page for more examples.

.. _-F:

**-F**\ [**l**\ \|\ **r**]
    Force dumped contours to be oriented so that higher z-values are to the
    left (**-Fl** [Default]) or right (**-Fr**) as we move along the contour
    [Default is arbitrary orientation]. Requires **-D**.

.. _-G:

**-G**\ [**d**\ \|\ **f**\ \|\ **n**\ \|\ **l**\ \|\ **L**\ \|\ **x**\ \|\ **X**]\ *params*

.. include:: explain_contlabel.rst_

.. _-L:

**-L**\ *low/high*\ \|\ **n**\ \|\ **N**\ \|\ **P**\ \|\ **p**
    Limit range: Do not draw contours for data values below *low* or
    above *high*.  Alternatively, limit contours to negative (**n**)
    or positive (**p**) contours.  Use upper case **N** or **P** to
    include the zero contour.

.. _-N:

**-N**\ [*cpt*]
    Fill the area between contours using the discrete color table given by *cpt*.
    Then, **-C** and **-A** can be used as well to control the contour lines and
    annotations.  If no *cpt* is appended then a discrete color table must be given
    via **-C** instead.

.. _-Q:

**-Q**\ [*cut*\ [*unit*]][\ **+z**]
    Do not draw contours with less than *cut* number of points [Draw all contours].
    Alternatively, give instead a minimum contour length in distance units
    (see :ref:`Unit_attributes` for available units and how distances are computed),
    including **c** (Cartesian distances using user coordinates) or **C** for plot
    length units in current plot units after projecting the coordinates.
    Optionally, append **z** to exclude the zero contour.

.. _-R:

.. |Add_-R| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: explain_-R.rst_

.. |Add_-Rz| replace:: [Default is region defined in the grid file].
.. include:: explain_-Rz.rst_

.. _-S:

**-S**\ *smoothfactor*
    Used to resample the contour lines at roughly every
    (gridbox_size/*smoothfactor*) interval.

.. _-T:

**-T**\ [**h**\ \|\ **l**][**+a**][**+d**\ *gap*\ [/*length*]][\ **+l**\ [*labels*]]
    Will draw tick marks pointing in the downward direction every *gap*
    along the innermost closed contours only; append **+a** to tick all closed
    contours. Append **+d**\ *gap* and optionally tick
    mark *length* (append units as **c**, **i**, or **p**) or use defaults
    [15\ **p**/3\ **p**]. User may choose to tick only local highs or local
    lows by specifying **-Th** or **-Tl**, respectively. Append
    **+l**\ *labels* to annotate the centers of closed innermost contours
    (i.e., the local lows and highs). If no *labels* is appended we use -
    and + as the labels. Appending exactly two characters, e.g., **+l**\ *LH*,
    will plot the two characters (here, L and H) as labels. For more elaborate
    labels, separate the low and high label strings with a comma (e.g.,
    **+l**\ *lo*,\ *hi*). If a file is given by **-C** and **-T** is set,
    then only contours marked with upper case C or A will have tick marks
    [and annotations].

.. _-U:

.. include:: explain_-U.rst_

.. _-V:

.. |Add_-V| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: explain_-V.rst_

.. _-W:

**-W**\ [*type*]\ *pen*\ [**+c**\ [**l**\ \|\ **f**]] :ref:`(more ...) <set-pens>`
    *type*, if present, can be **a** for annotated contours or **c** for
    regular contours [Default]. The *pen* sets the attributes for the
    particular line. Default pen for annotated contours: 0.75p,black.
    Regular contours use pen 0.25p,black. Normally, all contours are drawn
    with a fixed color determined by the pen setting. If the modifier **+cl** is appended
    then the color of the contour lines are taken from the CPT (see
    **-C**). If instead modifier **+cf** is appended then the color from the cpt
    file is applied to the contour annotations.  Select **+c** for both effects.

.. _-X:

.. include:: explain_-XY.rst_

.. _-Z:

**-Z**\ [**+s**\ *factor*][**+o**\ *shift*][**+p**]
    Use to subtract *shift* from the data and multiply the results by
    *factor* before contouring starts [1/0]. (Numbers in **-A**, **-C**,
    **-L** refer to values after this scaling has occurred.) Append
    **+p** to indicate that this grid file contains z-values that are
    periodic in 360 degrees (e.g., phase data, angular distributions)
    and that special precautions must be taken when determining
    0-contours.
