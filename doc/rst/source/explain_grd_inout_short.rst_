Grid File Formats
-----------------

By default GMT writes out grid as single precision floats in a
COARDS-complaint netCDF file format. However, GMT is able to produce
grid files in many other commonly used grid file formats and also
facilitates so called "packing" of grids, writing out floating point
data as 1- or 2-byte integers. :ref:`(more ...) <grd_inout_full>`
