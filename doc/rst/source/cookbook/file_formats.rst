.. _GMT File Formats:

GMT File Formats
================

Table data
----------

These files have *N* records which have *M* fields each. All programs
that handle tables can read multicolumn files. GMT can read both
ASCII, native binary, netCDF table data, and ESRI shapefiles (which
we convert to GMT/OGR format via GDAL's ogr2ogr tool under the hood).

ASCII tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optional file header records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first data record may be preceded by one or more header records. Any
records that begins with '#' is considered a header or comment line and
are always processed correctly. If your data file has leading header
records that do *not* start with '#' then you must make sure to use the
**-h** option and set the parameter :term:`IO_N_HEADER_RECS` in the :doc:`/gmt.conf` file
(GMT default is one header record if **-h** is given; you may also use
**-h**\ *nrecs* directly). Alternatively, you can override the header record marker '#'
by modifying the :term:`IO_HEADER_MARKER` default setting.
Fields within a record must be separated by
spaces, tabs, commas, or semi-colons. Each field can be an integer or floating-point
number or a geographic coordinate string using the
[Â±]\ *dd*\ [:*mm*\ [:*ss*\ [.\ *xx...*]]][**W**\|\ **E**\|\ **S**\|\ **N**\|\ **w**\|\ **e**\|\ **s**\|\ **n**]
format. Thus, 12:30:44.5W, 17.5S, 1:00:05, and 200:45E are all valid
input strings. GMT is expected to handle most CVS (Comma-Separated Values)
files, including numbers given in double quotes.  On output, fields will be separated by the character
given by the parameter :term:`IO_COL_SEPARATOR`, which by default is a TAB.

Optional segment header records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When dealing with time- or (*x,y*)-series it is usually convenient to
have each profile in separate files. However, this may sometimes prove
impractical due to large numbers of profiles. An example is files of
digitized lineations where the number of individual features may range
into the thousands. One file per feature would in this case be
unreasonable and furthermore clog up the directory. GMT provides a
mechanism for keeping more than one profile in a file. Such files are
called *multiple segment files* and are identical to the ones just
outlined except that they have segment headers interspersed with data
records that signal the start of a new segment. The segment headers may
be of any format, but all must have the same character in the first
column. The unique character is by default '\ >\ ', but you can
override that by modifying the :term:`IO_SEGMENT_MARKER` default setting.
Programs can examine the segment headers to see if they contain **-D**
for a distance value, **-W** and **-G** options for specifying pen and
fill attributes for individual segments, **-Z** to change color via a
CPT, **-L** for label specifications, or **-T** for general-purpose
text descriptions. These settings (and occasionally others) will
override the corresponding command line options. GMT also provides for
two special values for :term:`IO_SEGMENT_MARKER` that can make
interoperability with other software packages easier. Choose the marker
**B** to have blank lines recognized as segment breaks, or use **N** to
have data records whose fields equal NaN mean segment breaks (e.g., as
used by Matlab or Octave). When these markers are used then no other
segment header will be considered. Note that :term:`IO_SEGMENT_MARKER` can
be set differently for input and output.  Finally, if a segment represents
a closed polygon that is a hole inside another polygon you indicate this
by including **-Ph** in the segment header.  This setting will be read
and processed if converting a file to the OGR format.

Binary tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT programs also support native binary tables to speed up
input-output for i/o-intensive tasks like gridding and preprocessing.
This is discussed in more detail in section :ref:`option_-b`.

NetCDF tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More and more programs are now producing binary data in the netCDF
format, and so GMT programs started to support tabular netCDF data
(files containing one or more 1-dimensional arrays) starting with
GMT version 4.3.0. Because of the meta data contained in those files,
reading them is much less complex than reading native binary tables, and
even than ASCII tables. GMT programs will read as many 1-dimensional
columns as are needed by the program, starting with the first
1-dimensional it can find in the file. To specifically specify which
variables are to be read, append the suffix
**?**\ *var1*\ **/**\ *var2*\ **/**\ *...* to the netCDF file name or
add the option **-bic**\ *var1*\ **/**\ *var2*\ **/**\ *...*, where
*var1*, *var2*, etc.are the names of the variables to be processed. The
latter option is particularly practical when more than one file is read:
the **-bic** option will apply to all files. Currently, GMT only
reads, but does not write, netCDF tabular data.

Shapefiles
~~~~~~~~~~

GMT programs that read tables also support ESRI shapefiles, provided GMT was compiled
with GDAL support.  By default, only the geographic coordinates are read.  To select
some or all aspatial fields, see the :ref:`-a option <-aspatial_full>`.

Grid files
----------

GMT allows numerous grid formats to be read. In addition to the default
netCDF format it can use binary floating points, short integers, bytes, and
bits, as well as 8-bit Sun raster files (colormap ignored).  Additional
formats may be used by supplying read/write functions and linking these with
the GMT libraries. The source file ``gmt_customio.c`` has the information
that programmers will need to augment GMT to read custom grid files. See
Section :ref:`grid-file-format` for more information.

NetCDF files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, GMT stores 2-D grids as COARDS-compliant netCDF files.
COARDS (which stands for Cooperative Ocean/Atmosphere Research Data
Service) is a convention used by many agencies distributing gridded data
for ocean and atmosphere research. Sticking to this convention allows
GMT to read gridded data provided by other institutes and other
programs. Conversely, other general domain programs will be able to read
grids created by GMT. COARDS is a subset of a more extensive
convention for netCDF data called CF-1.5 (Climate and Forecast, version
1.5). Hence, GMT grids are also automatically CF-1.5-compliant.
However, since CF-1.5 has more general application than COARDS, not all
CF-1.5 compliant netCDF files can be read by GMT.

The netCDF grid file in GMT has several attributes (See Table
:ref:`netcdf-format <tbl-netcdf-format>`) to describe the content. The routine
that deals with netCDF grid files is sufficiently flexible so that grid files
slightly deviating from the standards used by GMT can also be read.

+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

By default, the first 2-dimensional variable in a netCDF file will be read as
the *z* variable and the coordinate axes *x* and *y* will be determined from
the dimensions of the *z* variable. GMT will recognize whether the *y*
(latitude) variable increases or decreases. Both forms of data storage are
handled appropriately.

For more information on the use of COARDS-compliant netCDF files, and on how
to load multi-dimensional grids, read Section :ref:`modifiers-for-CF`.

Chunking and compression with netCDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT supports reading and writing of netCDF-4 files since release 5.0.  For
performance reasons with ever-increasing grid sizes, the default output format
of GMT is netCDF-4 with chunking enabled for grids with more than 16384 cells.
Chunking means that the data are not stored sequentially in rows along latitude
but rather split up into tiles.  Figure :ref:`netcdf_chunking` illustrates
the layout in a chunked netCDF file.  To access a subset of the data (e.g.,
the four blue tiles in the lower left), netCDF only reads those tiles
("chunks") instead of extracting data from long rows.

.. _netcdf_chunking:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_chunking.*
   :align: center

   Grid split into 3 by 3 chunks

Gridded datasets in the earth sciences usually exhibit a strong spatial
dependence (e.g. topography, potential fields, illustrated by blue and white
cells in Figure :ref:`netcdf_chunking`) and deflation can greatly reduce the
file size and hence the file access time (deflating/inflating is faster than
hard disk I/O).  It is therefore convenient to deflate grids with spatial
dependence (levels 1â3 give the best speed/size-tradeoff).

You may control the size of the chunks of data and compression with the
configuration parameters :term:`IO_NC4_CHUNK_SIZE`
and :term:`IO_NC4_DEFLATION_LEVEL` as specified in
:doc:`/gmt.conf` and you can check the netCDF format with :doc:`/grdinfo`.

Classic netCDF files were the *de facto* standard until netCDF 4.0 was released
in 2008.  Most programs supporting netCDF by now are using the netCDF-4
library and are thus capable of reading netCDF files generated with GMT 5,
this includes official GMT releases since revision 4.5.8.  In rare occasions,
when you have to load netCDF files with old software, you may be forced to
export your grids in the old classic format.  This can be achieved by setting
:term:`IO_NC4_CHUNK_SIZE` to **c**\ lassic.

Gridline and Pixel node registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scanline format means that the data are stored in rows (*y* = constant)
going from the "top" (:math:`y = y_{max}` (north)) to the "bottom"
(:math:`y = y_{min}` (south)). Data within each row are ordered from
"left" (:math:`x = x_{min}` (west)) to "right" (:math:`x = x_{max}`
(east)). The *registration* signals how the nodes are laid out. The grid
is always defined as the intersections of all
*x* ( :math:`x = x_{min}, x_{min} + x_{inc}, x_{min} + 2 \cdot x_{inc}, \ldots, x_{max}` )
and *y* ( :math:`y = y_{min}, y_{min} + y_{inc}, y_{min} + 2 \cdot y_{inc}, \ldots, y_{max}` )
lines. The two scenarios differ as to which area each data point
represents. The default node registration in GMT is gridline node
registration. Most programs can handle both types, and for some programs
like :doc:`/grdimage` a pixel registered file
makes more sense. Utility programs like
:doc:`/grdsample` and
:doc:`/grdproject` will allow you to
convert from one format to the other;
:doc:`/grdedit` can make changes to the grid
header and convert a pixel- to a gridline-registered grid, or *vice
versa*. The grid registration is determined by the common GMT **-r**
option (see Section :ref:`option_nodereg`).

Boundary Conditions for operations on grids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT has the option to specify boundary conditions in some programs
that operate on grids (e.g.,
:doc:`/grdsample`, :doc:`/grdgradient`,
:doc:`/grdtrack`, :doc:`/nearneighbor`, and
:doc:`/grdview`, to name a few. The desired
condition can be set with the common GMT option **-n**; see Section
:ref:`option_-n`. The boundary conditions come into play when
interpolating or computing derivatives near the limits of the region
covered by the grid. The *default* boundary conditions used are those
which are "natural" for the boundary of a minimum curvature
interpolating surface. If the user knows that the data are periodic in
*x* (and/or *y*), or that the data cover a sphere with *x*,\ *y*
representing *longitude*,\ *latitude*, then there are better choices for
the boundary conditions. Periodic conditions on *x* (and/or *y*) are
chosen by specifying *x* (and/or *y*) as the boundary condition flags;
global spherical cases are specified using the *g* (geographical) flag.
Behavior of these conditions is as follows:

Periodic
    conditions on *x* indicate that the data are periodic in the
    distance (:math:`x_{max} - x_{min}`) and thus repeat values after
    every :math:`N = (x_{max} - x_{min})/x_{inc}`. Note that this
    implies that in a grid-registered file the values in the first and
    last columns are equal, since these are located at
    :math:`x = x_{min}` and :math:`x = x_{max}`, and there are
    *N + 1* columns in the file. This is not the case in a
    pixel-registered file, where there are only *N* and the first
    and last columns are located at :math:`x_{min} + x_{inc}/2` and
    :math:`x_{max} - x_{inc}/2`. If *y* is periodic all the same
    holds for *y*.

Geographical
    conditions indicate the following:

    #. If :math:`(x_{max} - x_{min}) \geq 360` and also 180 modulo
       :math:`x_{inc} = 0` then a periodic condition is used on
       *x* with a period of 360; else a default condition is used
       on the *x* boundaries.

    #. If condition 1 is true and also :math:`y_{max} = 90` then a
       "north pole condition" is used at :math:`y_{max}`, else a default
       condition is used there.

    #. If condition 1 is true and also :math:`y_{min} = -90` then a
       "south pole condition" is used at :math:`y_{min}`, else a default
       condition is used there.

    "Pole conditions" use a 180Âº phase-shift of the data, requiring 180
    modulo :math:`x_{inc} = 0`.

Default
    boundary conditions are

    .. math:: \nabla^2 f = \frac{\partial}{\partial n} \nabla^2 f = 0

    on the boundary, where :math:`f(x, y)` is represented by the values
    in the grid file, and :math:`\partial/\partial n` is the derivative
    in the direction normal to a boundary, and

    .. math:: \nabla^2 = \left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\right)

    is the two-dimensional Laplacian operator.

Native binary grid files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The old-style native grid file format that was common in earlier version
of GMT is still supported, although the use of netCDF files is
strongly recommended. The file starts with a header of 892 bytes
containing a number of attributes defining the content. The
:doc:`/grdedit` utility program will allow you
to edit parts of the header of an existing grid file. The attributes
listed in Table :ref:`grdheader <tbl-grdheader>` are contained within the header record
in the order given (except the *z*-array which is not part of the
header structure, but makes up the rest of the file). As this header was
designed long before 64-bit architectures became available, the jump
from the first three integers to the subsequent doubles in the structure
does not occur on a 16-byte alignment. While GMT handles the reading
of these structures correctly, enterprising programmers must take care
to read this header correctly (see our code for details).

Sun raster files
----------------

The Sun raster file format consists of a header followed by a series of
unsigned 1-byte integers that represents the bit-pattern. Bits are
scanline oriented, and each row must contain an even number of bytes.
The predefined 1-bit patterns in GMT have dimensions of 64 by 64, but
other sizes will be accepted when using the **-Gp|P** option. The Sun
header structure is outline in Table :ref:`sunheader <tbl-sunheader>`.

.. _tbl-sunheader:

follows for *ras_maplength* bytes, followed by an image of
*ras_length* bytes. Some related definitions are given in
Table :ref:`sundef <tbl-sundef>`.

Numerous public-domain programs exist, such as **xv** and
**convert** (in the GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick package), that will translate between
various raster file formats such as tiff, gif, jpeg, and Sun raster.
Raster patterns may be created with GMT plotting tools by generating
PostScript plots that can be rasterized by ghostscript and
translated into the right raster format.
