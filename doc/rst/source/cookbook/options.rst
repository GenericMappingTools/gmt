Standardized command line options
=================================

Most of the programs take many of the same arguments such as those related
to setting the data region, the map projection, etc. The switches in
Table :ref:`switches <tbl-switches>` have the same meaning in all the programs (although
some programs may not use all of them). These options will be described
here as well as in the manual pages, as is vital that you understand how
to use these options. We will present these options in order of
importance (some are used a lot more than others).

.. _option_-R:

Data domain or map region: The **-R** option
--------------------------------------------

The **-R** option defines the map region or data domain of interest. It
may be specified in one of five ways, two of which are shown in Figure
:ref:`Map region <gmt_region>`:

#. **-R**\ *xmin*/*xmax*/*ymin*/*ymax*. This is the standard way to
   specify Cartesian data domains and geographical regions when using
   map projections where meridians and parallels are rectilinear.

#. **-R**\ *xlleft*/*ylleft*/*xuright*/*yuright*\ **+r**. This form is
   used with map projections that are oblique, making meridians and
   parallels poor choices for map boundaries. Here, we instead specify
   the lower left corner and upper right corner geographic coordinates,
   followed by the modifier **+r**. This form guarantees a rectangular map
   even though lines of equal longitude and latitude are not straight lines.

#. **-R**\ *gridfile*. This will copy the domain settings found for the
   grid in specified file. Note that depending on the nature of the
   calling program, this mechanism will also set grid spacing and
   possibly the grid registration (see
   Section `Grid registration: The -r option`_).

#. **-R**\ *code1,code2,...*\ [**+r**\|\ **R**\ [*incs*]]. This indirectly supplies
   the region by consulting the DCW (Digital Chart of the World) database and derives
   the bounding regions for one or more countries given by the codes.
   Simply append one or more comma-separated countries using the two-character
   ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 convention (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
   To select a state within a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
   To specify a whole continent, prepend = to any of the continent codes AF (Africa),
   AN (Antarctica), AS (Asia), EU (Europe), OC (Oceania), NA (North America), or SA
   (South America).  Append **+r** to modify exact bounding box coordinates obtained from
   the polygon(s): Append *inc*, *xinc*/*yinc*, or *winc*/*einc*/*sinc*/*ninc* to adjust the
   final region boundaries to be multiples of these steps [default is no adjustment].
   Alternatively, use **+R** to extend the region outward by adding these increments
   instead [default is no extension].  As an example, **-R**\ *FR*\ **+r**\ 1 will select
   the national bounding box of France rounded to nearest integer degree.

#. **-R**\ *code*\ *x0*/*y0*/*nx*/*ny*.  This method can be used when creating
   grids.  Here, *code* is a 2-character combination of **L**\ , **C**\ , **R** (for left, center,
   or right) and **T**\ , **M**\ , **B** for top, middle, or bottom. e.g., **BL** for lower left.  This
   indicates which point on a rectangular grid region the *x0*/*y0* coordinates
   refer to, and the grid dimensions *nx* and *ny* are used with grid spacings given
   via **-I** to create the corresponding region.

.. _gmt_region:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-R.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   The plot region can be specified in two different ways. (a) Extreme values
   for each dimension, or (b) coordinates of lower left and upper right corners.

For rectilinear projections the first two forms give identical results.
Depending on the selected map projection (or the kind of expected input
data), the boundary coordinates may take on several different formats:

Geographic coordinates:
    These are longitudes and latitudes and may be given in decimal
    degrees (e.g., -123.45417) or in the
    [±]\ *ddd*\ [:*mm*\ [:*ss*\ [*.xxx*]]][**W**\|\ **E**\|\ **S**\|\ **N**]
    format (e.g., 123:27:15W). Note that **-Rg** and **-Rd** are
    shorthands for "global domain" **-R**\ *0*/*360*/*-90*/*90* and
    **-R**\ *-180*/*180*/*-90*/*90*, respectively.

    When used in conjunction with the Cartesian Linear Transformation
    (**-Jx** or **-JX**) —which can be used to map floating point data,
    geographical coordinates, as well as time coordinates— it is prudent
    to indicate that you are using geographical coordinates in one of
    the following ways:

    -  Use **-Rg** or **-Rd** to indicate the global domain.

    -  Use **-Rg**\ *xmin*/*xmax*/*ymin*/*ymax* to indicate a limited
       geographic domain.

    -  Add **W**, **E**, **S**, or **N** to the coordinate limits or add
       the generic **D** or **G**. Example:
       **-R**\ *0*/*360G*/*-90*/*90N*.

    Alternatively, you may indicate geographical coordinates by
    supplying **-fg**; see Section `Data type selection: The -f option`_.

Projected coordinates:
    These are Cartesian projected coordinates compatible with the chosen
    projection and are given in a length *unit* set via the **+u** modifier, (e.g.,
    -200/200/-300/300\ **+uk** for a 400 by 600 km rectangular area centered
    on the projection center (0, 0). These coordinates are internally
    converted to the corresponding geographic (longitude, latitude)
    coordinates for the lower left and upper right corners. This form is
    convenient when you want to specify a region directly in the
    projected units (e.g., UTM meters). For allowable units, see
    Table :ref:`distunits <tbl-distunits>`.

Calendar time coordinates:
    These are absolute time coordinates referring to a Gregorian or ISO
    calendar. The general format is [*date*]\ **T**\ [*clock*],
    where *date* must be in the *yyyy*\ [*-mm*\ [*-dd*]] (year, month,
    day-of-month) or *yyyy*\ [*-jjj*] (year and day-of-year) for
    Gregorian calendars and *yyyy*\ [*-*\ **W**\ *ww*\ [*-d*]] (year,
    week, and day-of-week) for the ISO calendar. Note: this format requirement
    only applies to command-line arguments and not time coordinates given via
    data files.  If no *date* is given
    we assume the current day. The **T** flag is required if a *clock* is given.

    The optional *clock* string is a 24-hour clock in
    *hh*\ [*:mm*\ [*:ss*\ [*.xxx*]]] format. If no *clock* is given it
    implies 00:00:00, i.e., the start of the specified day. Note that
    not all of the specified entities need be present in the data. All
    calendar date-clock strings are internally represented as double
    precision seconds since proleptic Gregorian date Monday January 1
    00:00:00 0001. Proleptic means we assume that the modern calendar
    can be extrapolated forward and backward; a year zero is used, and
    Gregory's reforms [11]_ are extrapolated backward. Note that this is
    not historical.

Relative time coordinates:
    These are coordinates which count seconds, hours, days or years
    relative to a given epoch. A combination of the parameters
    :term:`TIME_EPOCH` and :term:`TIME_UNIT` define the epoch and time unit.
    The parameter :term:`TIME_SYSTEM` provides a few shorthands for common
    combinations of epoch and unit, like **j2000** for days since noon
    of 1 Jan 2000. The default relative time coordinate is that of UNIX
    computers: seconds since 1 Jan 1970. Denote relative time
    coordinates by appending the optional lower case **t** after the
    value. When it is otherwise apparent that the coordinate is relative
    time (for example by using the **-f** switch), the **t** can be omitted.

Radians:
    For angular regions (and increments) specified in radians you may use a set of
    forms indicating multiples or fractions of :math:`\pi`.  Valid forms are
    [±][*s*]pi[*f*], where *s* and *f* are any integer or floating point numbers,
    e.g., -2pi/2pi3 goes from -360 to 120 degrees (but in radians).  When GMT parses one
    of these forms we alert the labeling machinery to look for certain combinations of pi,
    limited to *n*\ pi, 1.5pi, and fractions 3/4, 2/3, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 pi.  When an
    annotated value is within roundoff-error of these combinations we typeset the label
    using the Greek letter for pi and required multiples or fractions.

Other coordinates:
    These are simply any coordinates that are not related to geographic
    or calendar time or relative time and are expected to be simple
    floating point values such as
    [±]\ *xxx.xxx*\ [**E**\|\ **e**\|\ **D**\|\ **d**\ [±]\ *xx*],
    i.e., regular or exponential notations, with the enhancement to understand
    FORTRAN double precision output which may use **D** instead of **E** for
    exponents. These values are simply converted as they are to internal
    representation. [12]_

.. _option_-J:

Coordinate transformations and map projections: The **-J** option
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This option selects the coordinate transformation or map projection. The
general format is

-  **-J**\ :math:`\delta`\ [*parameters*/]\ *scale*. Here, :math:`\delta`
   is a *lower-case* letter of the alphabet that selects a particular
   map projection, the *parameters* is zero or more slash-delimited
   projection parameter, and *scale* is map scale given in distance
   units per degree or as 1:xxxxx.

-  **-J**\ :math:`\Delta`\ [*parameters*/]\ *width*. Here, :math:`\Delta`
   is an *upper-case* letter of the alphabet that selects a particular
   map projection, the *parameters* is zero or more slash-delimited
   projection parameter, and *width* is map width (map height is
   automatically computed from the implied map scale and region).

Since GMT version 4.3.0, there is an alternative way to specify the
projections: use the same abbreviation as in the mapping package
**Proj4**. The options thus either look like:

-  **-J**\ *abbrev*/[*parameters*/]\ *scale*. Here, *abbrev* is a
   *lower-case* abbreviation that selects a particular map projection,
   the *parameters* is zero or more slash-delimited projection
   parameter, and *scale* is map scale given in distance units per
   degree or as 1:xxxxx.

-  **-J**\ *Abbrev*/[*parameters*/]\ *width*. Here, *Abbrev* is an
   *capitalized* abbreviation that selects a particular map projection,
   the *parameters* is zero or more slash-delimited projection
   parameter, and *width* is map width (map height is automatically
   computed from the implied map scale and region).

The projections available in GMT are presented in Figure
:ref:`gmt_projections`. For details on all GMT projections and the required
parameters, see the :doc:`/basemap` man page. We will also show examples of
every projection in the next Chapters, and a quick summary of projection
syntax is listed in :doc:`/proj_codes`.

.. _option_-B:

Map frame and axes annotations: The **-B** option
-------------------------------------------------

This is potentially the most complicated option in GMT,
but most examples of its usage are actually quite simple. We distinguish
between to sets of information: Frame settings and Axes parameters.  These
are set separately by their own **-B** invocations; hence multiple **-B**
specifications may be specified. The frame settings covers things such
as which axes should be plotted, canvas fill, plot title, and what type
of gridlines be drawn, whereas the Axes settings deal with annotation,
tick, and gridline intervals, axes labels, and annotation units.

The Frame settings are specified by

-  **-B**\ [*axes*][**+b**][**+g**\ *fill*][**+n**][**+o**\ *lon/lat*][**+t**\ *title*]

Here, the optional *axes* dictates which of the axes should be drawn
and possibly annotated.  By default, all 4 map boundaries (or plot axes)
are plotted (denoted **W**, **E**, **S**, **N**). To change this selection,
append the codes for those you want (e.g., **WSn**). In this example,
the lower case **n** denotes to draw the axis and (major and minor) tick
marks on the "northern" (top) edge of the plot. The upper case **WS** will
annotate the "western" and "southern" axes with numerals and plot the
any axis labels in addition to draw axis/tick-marks.  For 3-D plots you can
also specify **Z** or **z**.  By default a single vertical axes will then be
plotted at the most suitable map corner.  You can override this by appending
any combination of corner ids **1234**, where **1** represents the lower left
corner and the order goes counter-clockwise.  Append **+b** to draw the outline
of the 3-D box defined by **-R**; this modifier is also needed to display
gridlines in the x–z, y–z planes.  You may paint the
map canvas by appending the **+g**\ *fill* modifier [Default is no fill].
If gridlines are specified via the Axes parameters (discussed below) then
by default these are referenced to the North pole.  If, however, you wish
to produce oblique gridlines about another pole you can append **+o**\ *lon/lat*
to change this behavior (the modifier is ignored if no gridlines are requested).
Append **+n** to have no frame and annotations at all [Default is controlled by the codes].
Finally, you may optionally add **+t**\ *title* to place a title that
will appear centered above the plot frame.

The Axes settings are specified by

-  **-B**\ [**p**\|\ **s**][**x**\|\ **y**\|\ **z**]\ *intervals*\ [**+a**\ *angle*\|\ **n**\|\ **p**][**+l**\ *label*][**+p**\ *prefix*][**+u**\ *unit*]

but you may also split this into two separate invocations for clarity, i.e.,

-   **-B**\ [**p**\|\ **s**][**x**\|\ **y**\|\ **z**][**+a**\ *angle*\|\ **n**\|\ **p**][**+l**\|\ **L**\ *label*][**+p**\ *prefix*][**+s**\|\ **S**\ *seclabel*][**+u**\ *unit*]
-   **-B**\ [**p**\|\ **s**][**x**\|\ **y**\|\ **z**]\ *intervals*

    The first optional flag following **-B** selects **p** (rimary) [Default] or
    **s** (econdary) axes information (mostly used for time axes annotations).
    The [**x**\|\ **y**\|\ **z**] flags specify which axes you are providing information for.
    If none are given then we default to **xy**.  If you wish to give different annotation intervals
    or labels for the various axes then you must repeat the **B** option for
    each axis (If a 3-D basemap is selected with **-p** and **-Jz**, use **-Bz**
    to give settings for the vertical axis.).  To add a label to an axis,
    just append **+l**\ *label* (Cartesian projections only). Use **+L** to
    force a horizontal label for *y*-axes (useful for very short labels).
    For Cartesian axes you may specify an alternate via **+s** which is used for
    right or upper axis axis label (with any **+l** label used for left and bottom axes).
    If the axis annotation should have a leading text prefix (e.g., dollar sign for those
    plots of your net worth) you can append **+p**\ *prefix*. For geographic maps
    the addition of degree symbols, etc. is automatic (and controlled by the GMT
    default setting :term:`FORMAT_GEO_MAP`). However, for other plots you can add
    specific units by adding **+u**\ *unit*.  If any of these text strings contain
    spaces or special characters you will need to enclose them in quotes.
    Cartesian x-axes also allow for the optional **+a**\ *angle*, which
    will plot slanted annotations; *angle* is measured with respect to the horizontal
    and must be in the -90 <= *angle* <= 90 range only.  Also, **+an** is a shorthand
    for normal (i.e., **+a**\ 90) and **+ap** for parallel (i.e., **+a**\ 0) annotations
    [Default].  For the y-axis, arbitrary angles are not allowed but **+an** and **+ap**
    specify annotations normal [Default] and parallel to the axis, respectively.  Note that
    these defaults can be changed via :term:`MAP_ANNOT_ORTHO`.

The *intervals* specification is a concatenated string made up of substrings of the form

[**t**]\ *stride*\ [*phase*][**u**].

The **t** flag sets the axis
item of interest; the available items are listed in Table :ref:`inttype <tbl-inttype>`.
Normally, equidistant annotations occur at multiples of *stride*; you
can phase-shift this by appending *phase*, which can be a positive or
negative number.

.. _tbl-inttype:

+------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Flag**   | **Description**                     |
+============+=====================================+
| **a**      | Annotation and major tick spacing   |
+------------+-------------------------------------+
| **f**      | Minor tick spacing                  |
+------------+-------------------------------------+
| **g**      | Grid line spacing                   |
+------------+-------------------------------------+

Note that the appearance of certain time annotations (month-, week-, and
day-names) may be affected by the :term:`GMT_LANGUAGE`,
:term:`FORMAT_TIME_PRIMARY_MAP`, and
:term:`FORMAT_TIME_SECONDARY_MAP` settings.

For automated plots the region may not always be the same and thus it
can be difficult to determine the appropriate *stride* in advance. Here
GMT provides the opportunity to auto-select the spacing between the
major and minor ticks and the grid lines, by not specifying the *stride*
value. For example, **-Bafg** will select all three spacings
automatically for both axes. In case of longitude–latitude plots, this
will keep the spacing the same on both axes. You can also use
**-Bafg/afg** to auto-select them separately. Also note that given the
myriad ways of specifying time-axis annotations, the automatic selections
may have to be overridden with manual settings to active exactly what you need.

In the case of automatic spacing, when the *stride* argument is omitted
after **g**, the grid line spacing is chosen the same as the minor tick
spacing; unless **g** is used in consort with **a**, then the grid lines
are spaced the same as the annotations.

The unit flag **u** can take on one of 18 codes; these are listed in
Table :ref:`units <tbl-units>`. Almost all of these units are time-axis specific.
However, the **m** and **s** units will be interpreted as arc minutes
and arc seconds, respectively, when a map projection is in effect.

+------------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

As mentioned, there may be two levels of annotations. Here, "primary" refers to the
annotation that is closest to the axis (this is the primary annotation),
while "secondary" refers to the secondary annotation that is plotted
further from the axis. The examples below will clarify what is meant.
Note that the terms "primary" and "secondary" do not reflect any
hierarchical order of units: The "primary" annotation interval is
usually smaller (e.g., days) while the "secondary" annotation interval
typically is larger (e.g., months).

Geographic basemaps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Geographic basemaps may differ from regular plot axis in that some
projections support a "fancy" form of axis and is selected by the
:term:`MAP_FRAME_TYPE` setting. The annotations will be formatted
according to the :term:`FORMAT_GEO_MAP` template and
:term:`MAP_DEGREE_SYMBOL` setting. A simple example of part of a basemap
is shown in Figure :ref:`Geographic map border <basemap_border>`.

.. _basemap_border:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_geo_1.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Geographic map border using separate selections for annotation,
   frame, and grid intervals.  Formatting of the annotation is controlled by
   the parameter :term:`FORMAT_GEO_MAP` in your :doc:`/gmt.conf`.

The machinery for primary and secondary annotations introduced for
time-series axes can also be utilized for geographic basemaps. This may
be used to separate degree annotations from minutes- and
seconds-annotations. For a more complicated basemap example using
several sets of intervals, including different intervals and pen
attributes for grid lines and grid crosses, see Figure :ref:`Complex basemap
<complex_basemap>`.

.. _complex_basemap:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_geo_2.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Geographic map border with both primary (P) and secondary (S) components.

Cartesian linear axes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For non-geographic axes, the :term:`MAP_FRAME_TYPE` setting is implicitly
set to plain. Other than that, cartesian linear axes are very similar to
geographic axes. The annotation format may be controlled with the
:term:`FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT` parameter. By default, it is set to "%g", which
is a C language format statement for floating point numbers [13]_, and
with this setting the various axis routines will automatically determine
how many decimal points should be used by inspecting the *stride*
settings. If :term:`FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT` is set to another format it will be
used directly (.e.g, "%.2f" for a fixed, two decimals format). Note that
for these axes you may use the *unit* setting to add a unit string to
each annotation (see Figure :ref:`Axis label <axis_label_basemap>`).

.. _axis_label_basemap:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_linear.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Linear Cartesian projection axis.  Long tick-marks accompany
   annotations, shorter ticks indicate frame interval. The axis label is
   optional. For this example we used ``-R0/12/0/0.95 -JX7.5c/0.75c -Ba4f2g1+lFrequency+u" %" -BS``

There are occasions when the length of the annotations are such that placing them
horizontally (which is the default) may lead to overprinting or too few annotations.
One solution is to request slanted annotations for the x-axis (e.g., Figure :ref:`Axis label <axis_slanted_basemap>`)
via the **+a**\ *angle* modifier.


.. _axis_slanted_basemap:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_slanted.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Linear Cartesian projection axis with slanted annotations.
   For this example we used ``-R2000/2020/35/45 -JX12c -Bxa2f+a-30 -BS``.
   For the y-axis only the modifier **+ap** for parallel is allowed.


Cartesian log\ :sub:`10` axes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the logarithmic nature of annotation spacings, the *stride*
parameter takes on specific meanings. The following concerns are
specific to log axes (see Figure :ref:`Logarithmic projection axis
<Log_projection>`):

*  *stride* must be 1, 2, 3, or a negative integer -n.
   Annotations/ticks will then occur at 1, 1-2-5, or 1,2,3,4,...,9,
   respectively, for each magnitude range. For *-n* the
   annotations will take place every *n*\ 'th magnitude.

*  Append **l** to *stride*. Then, log\ :sub:`10` of the annotation
   is plotted at every integer log\ :sub:`10` value (e.g.,
   *x = 100* will be annotated as "2") [Default annotates *x* as is].

*  Append **p** to *stride*. Then, annotations appear as 10 raised to
   log\ :sub:`10` of the value (e.g., 10\ :sup:`-5`).

.. _Log_projection:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_log.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Logarithmic projection axis using separate values for annotation,
   frame, and grid intervals.  (top) Here, we have chosen to annotate the actual
   values.  Interval = 1 means every whole power of 10, 2 means 1, 2, 5 times
   powers of 10, and 3 means every 0.1 times powers of 10.  We used
   -R1/1000/0/1 -JX7.5cl/0.6c -Ba1f2g3. (middle) Here, we have chosen to
   annotate :math:`\log_{10}` of the actual values, with -Ba1f2g3l.
   (bottom) We annotate every power of 10 using :math:`\log_{10}` of the actual
   values as exponents, with -Ba1f2g3p.

Cartesian exponential axes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Normally, *stride* will be used to create equidistant (in the user's
unit) annotations or ticks, but because of the exponential nature of the
axis, such annotations may converge on each other at one end of the
axis. To avoid this problem, you can append **p** to *stride*, and the
annotation interval is expected to be in transformed units, yet the
annotation itself will be plotted as un-transformed units (see Figure
:ref:`Power projection axis <Pow_projection>`). E.g., if
*stride* = 1 and power = 0.5 (i.e., sqrt), then equidistant annotations
labeled 1, 4, 9, ... will appear.

.. _Pow_projection:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_pow.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Exponential or power projection axis. (top) Using an exponent of 0.5
   yields a :math:`sqrt(x)` axis.  Here, intervals refer to actual data values,
   in -R0/100/0/0.9 -JX3ip0.5/0.25i -Ba20f10g5.
   (bottom) Here, intervals refer to projected values, although the annotation
   uses the corresponding unprojected values, as in -Ba3f2g1p.

.. _cartesian_time_axes:

Cartesian time axes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What sets time axis apart from the other kinds of plot axes is the
numerous ways in which we may want to tick and annotate the axis. Not
only do we have both primary and secondary annotation items but we also
have interval annotations versus tick-mark annotations, numerous time
units, and several ways in which to modify the plot. We will demonstrate
this flexibility with a series of examples. While all our examples will
only show a single *x*\ -axis (south, selected via **-BS**), time-axis
annotations are supported for all axes.

Our first example shows a time period of almost two months in Spring
2000. We want to annotate the month intervals as well as the date at the start of each week:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_-B_time1.txt

These commands result in Figure :ref:`Cartesian time axis <cartesian_axis1>`.
Note the leading hyphen in the :term:`FORMAT_DATE_MAP`
removes leading zeros from calendar items (e.g., 02 becomes 2).

.. _cartesian_axis1:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time1.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 1

The next example shows two different ways to annotate an axis portraying 2 days in July 1969:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_-B_time2.txt

The lower example (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis2`) chooses to annotate the weekdays (by
specifying **a**\ 1\ **K**) while the upper example choses dates (by
specifying **a**\ 1\ **D**). Note how the clock format only selects
hours and minutes (no seconds) and the date format selects a month name,
followed by one space and a two-digit day-of-month number.

.. _cartesian_axis2:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time2.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 2

The third example (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis3`) presents two years, annotating
both the years and every 3rd month.

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_-B_time3.txt

Note that while the year annotation is centered on the 1-year interval,
the month annotations must be centered on the corresponding month and
*not* the 3-month interval. The :term:`FORMAT_DATE_MAP` selects month name
only and :term:`FORMAT_TIME_PRIMARY_MAP` selects the 1-character, upper
case abbreviation of month names using the current language (selected by
:term:`GMT_LANGUAGE`).

.. _cartesian_axis3:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time3.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 3

The fourth example (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis4`) only shows a few hours of a day, using
relative time by specifying **t** in the **-R** option while the
:term:`TIME_UNIT` is **d** (for days). We select both primary and secondary
annotations, ask for a 12-hour clock, and let time go from right to left:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_-B_time4.txt

.. _cartesian_axis4:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time4.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 4

The fifth example shows a few weeks of time (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis5`). The lower axis
shows ISO weeks with week numbers and abbreviated names of the weekdays.
The upper uses Gregorian weeks (which start at the day chosen by
:term:`TIME_WEEK_START`); they do not have numbers.

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_-B_time5.txt

.. _cartesian_axis5:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time5.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 5

Our sixth example (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis6`) shows the first five months of
1996, and we have annotated each month with an abbreviated, upper case name and
2-digit year. Only the primary axes information is specified.

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_-B_time6.txt

.. _cartesian_axis6:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time6.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 6

Our seventh and final example (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis7`) illustrates
annotation of year-days. Unless we specify the formatting with a leading hyphen
in :term:`FORMAT_DATE_MAP` we get 3-digit integer days. Note that
in order to have the two years annotated we need to allow for the annotation of
small fractional intervals; normally such truncated interval must be at
least half of a full interval.

.. _custom_axes:

Custom axes
^^^^^^^^^^^

Irregularly spaced annotations or annotations based on
look-up tables can be implemented using the *custom* annotation
mechanism. Here, we given the **c** (custom) type to the **-B** option
followed by a filename that contains the annotations (and
tick/grid-lines specifications) for one axis. The file can contain any
number of comments (lines starting with #) and any number of records of
the format

| *coord* *type* [*label*]

The *coord* is the location of the desired annotation, tick, or
grid-line, whereas *type* is a string composed of letters from **a**
(annotation), **i** interval annotation, **f** frame tick, and **g**
gridline. You must use either **a** or **i** within one file; no mixing
is allowed. The coordinates should be arranged in increasing order. If
*label* is given it replaces the normal annotation based on the *coord*
value. Our last example (Figure :ref:`Custom and irregular annotations
<Custom_annotations>`) shows such a custom basemap with an interval
annotations on the *x*-axis and irregular annotations on the *y*-axis.

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_-B_custom.txt

.. _Custom_annotations:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_custom.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Custom and irregular annotations, tick-marks, and gridlines.

.. _option_-U:

Timestamps on plots: The **-U** option
--------------------------------------

The **-U** option draws the GMT UNIX System time stamp on the plot.
By appending **+j**\ *just* and/or **+o**\ *dx/dy*, the user may
specify the justification of the stamp and where the stamp should fall
on the page relative to lower left corner of the plot.
For example, +jBL+o0/0 will align the lower left corner of the time stamp
with the bottom left corner of the plot [BL]. Optionally, append  an
arbitrary text string (surrounded by double quotes), or give **+c**,
which will plot the current command string (Figure :ref:`Time stamp <fig_-U>`).

.. _fig_-U:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-U.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   The -U option makes it easy to date a plot.

.. _option_-V:

Verbose feedback: The **-V** option
-----------------------------------

The **-V** option controls the verbosity mode, which determines which
messages are sent to standard error [Default **-Vw** reports errors and warnings].
Even more verbose levels are **-Vi**(or just **-V**; for informational messages)
and **-Vd** (debug). If compiled with backward-compatibility
you can select **-Vc**, which includes warnings about deprecated usage.  To study
the run-time of time-intensive algoriths you can use **-Vt** (where available).
Finally, **-Vq** can be used to run without any warnings or errors. This
option can also be set by specifying the default :term:`GMT_VERBOSE`, as
**quiet**, **error**, **warning**, **timing**, **compat**, **information**, or
**debug**, in order of increased verbosity.

.. _option_-X:
.. _option_-Y:

Plot positioning and layout: The **-X** **-Y** options
------------------------------------------------------

The **-X** and **-Y** options shift plot origin relative to the current origin by
(*xshift*,\ *yshift*); optionally append the length unit
(**c**, **i**, or **p**). Default is (:term:`MAP_ORIGIN_X`,
:term:`MAP_ORIGIN_Y`) for new plots [15]_. Subsequent overlays will
be co-registered with the previous plot unless the origin is shifted using
these options.  You can prepend **a** to shift the origin
back to the original position after the plot module completes, prepend **c** to
center the plot on the center of the paper (optionally add a shift),
prepend **f** to shift the origin relative to the fixed lower left
corner of the page, or prepend **r** [Default] to move the origin
relative to its current location.  When **-X**
or **-Y** are used without any further arguments, the values from
the last use of that option in a previous GMT command will be used.
Note that **-X** and **-Y** can also access the previous plot bounding box dimensions
*w* and *h* and construct offsets that involves them.  For instance, to move the origin
up 2 cm beyond the height of the previous plot, use **-Y**\ *h*\ +2c.
To move the origin half the width to the right, use **-X**\ *w*\ /2.

.. _XY_options:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-XY.*
   :width: 300 px
   :align: center

   Plot origin can be translated freely with -X -Y.

.. _option_-a:

OGR/GMT GIS i/o: The **-a** option
----------------------------------

GMT relies on external tools to translate geospatial files such as
shapefiles into a format we can read. The tool **ogr2ogr** in the GDAL
package can do such translations and preserve the aspatial metadata via
a new OGR/GMT format specification (See Chapter :doc:`ogrgmt_format`).
For this to be useful we need a mechanism to associate certain metadata values with
required input and output columns expected by GMT programs. The **-a**
option allows you to supply one or more comma-separated associations
*col=name*, where *name* is the name of an aspatial attribute field in a
OGR/GMT file and whose value we wish to as data input for column *col*.
The given aspatial field thus replaces any other value already set. Note
that *col = 0* is the first data columns. Note that if no aspatial
attributes are needed then the **-a** option is not needed – GMT will
still process and read such data files.

OGR/GMT input with **-a** option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to populate GMT data columns with (constant) values
specified by aspatial attributes, use **-a** and append any number of
comma-separated *col=name* associations. E.g., *2=depth* will read the
spatial *x,y* columns from the file and add a third (*z*) column based
on the value of the aspatial field called *depth*. You can also
associate aspatial fields with other settings such as labels, fill
colors, pens, and values used to look-up colors. Do so by letting the
*col* value be one of **D**, **G**, **L**, **T**, **W**, or **Z**. This
works analogously to how standard multi-segment files can pass such
options via its segment headers (See Chapter :doc:`file_formats`).

OGR/GMT output with **-a** option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also make GMT table-writing tools output the OGR/GMT format
directly. Again, specify if certain GMT data columns with constant
values should be stored as aspatial metadata using the
*col=name*\ [:*type*], where you can optionally specify what data type
it should be (double, integer, string, logical, byte, or datetime)
[double is default]. As for input, you can also use the special *col*
entries of **D**, **G**, **L**, **T**, **W**, or **Z** to have values
stored as options in segment headers be used as the source for the name
aspatial field. Finally, for output you must append
+\ **g**\ *geometry*, where *geometry* can be any of
[**M**]\ **POINT**\|\ **LINE**\|\ **POLY**; the
**M** represent the multi-versions of these three geometries. Use
upper-case +\ **G** to signal that you want to split any line or polygon
features that straddle the Dateline.

.. _option_-binary:

Binary table i/o: The **-b** option
-----------------------------------

All GMT programs that accept table data as *primary* input may read ASCII, native
binary, shapefiles, or netCDF tables (Any *secondary* input files provided via command line
options are always expected to be in ASCII format). Native binary files may have a header section
and the **-h**\ *n* option (see Section `Header data records: The -h option`_) can be used to
skip the first *n* bytes. The data record can be in any format, you may mix
different data types and even byte-swap individual columns or the entire record. When using
native binary data the user must be aware of the fact that GMT has no
way of determining the actual number of columns in the file. You must
therefore pass that information to GMT via the binary
**-bi** *n*\ **t** option, where *n* is the number of data
columns of given type **t**, where **t** must be one of **c** (signed 1-byte character,
int8_t), **u** (unsigned 1-byte character, uint8_t), **h** (signed
2-byte int, int16_t), **H** (unsigned 2-byte int, uint16_t), **i**
(signed 4-byte int, int32_t), **I** (unsigned 4-byte int, uint32_t),
**l** (signed 8-byte int, int64_t), **L** (unsigned 8-byte int,
uint64_t), **f** (4-byte single-precision float), and **d** (8-byte
double-precision float). In addition, use **x** to skip *n* bytes
anywhere in the record. For a mixed-type data record you can concatenate
several [*n*]\ **t** combinations, separated by commas. You may append
**w** to any of the items to force byte-swapping. Alternatively, append
**+l**\|\ **b** to indicate that the entire data file should be
read or written as little- or big-endian, respectively. Here, *n* is the
number of each item in your binary file. Note that *n* may be larger
than *m*, the number of columns that the GMT program requires to do
its task. If *n* is not given then it defaults to *m* and all columns
are assumed to be of the single specified type **t** [**d** (double), if
not set]. If *n* < *m* an error is generated. Multiple segment
files are allowed and the segment headers are assumed to be records
where all the fields equal NaN.

For native binary output, use the **-bo** option; see **-bi** for further details.

Because of its meta data, reading netCDF tables (i.e., netCDF files
containing 1-dimensional arrays) is quite a bit less complex than
reading native binary files. When feeding netCDF tables to programs like
:doc:`/plot`, the program will automatically
recognize the format and read whatever amount of columns are needed for
that program. To steer which columns are to be read, the user can append
the suffix **?**\ *var1*\ **/**\ *var2*\ **/**\ *...* to the netCDF file
name, where *var1*, *var2*, etc. are the names of the variables to be
processed. No **-bi** option is needed in this case.

Currently, netCDF tables can only be input, not output. For more
information, see Chapter :doc:`file_formats`.

.. _option_-c:

Selecting subplot panels: The **-c** option
-------------------------------------------

When using :doc:`/subplot` to assemble multiple individual panels in a
matrix layout, we use **-c** to either advance the focus of plotting to
the next panel in the sequence (either by row or by column as set by
subplot's **-A** option) or to specify directly the *row*,\ *col* or
1-D *index* of the desired panel.  The **-c** option is only allowed
when in subplot mode.  If no **-c** option is given for the first plot
then we default to *row* = *col* = *index* = 0, i.e., the upper left
panel.  Note: *row*, *col*, and *index* all start at 0.

.. _option_-d:

Missing data conversion: The **-d** option
------------------------------------------

Within GMT, any missing values are represented by the IEEE NaN value.
However, there are occasionally the need to handle user data where
missing data are represented by some unlikely data value such as -99999.
Since GMT cannot guess that in your data set -99999 is a special value,
you can use the **-d** option to have such values replaced with NaNs.
Similarly, should your GMT output need to conform to such a requirement
you can replace all NaNs with the chosen nodata value.  If only input
or output should be affected, use **-di** or **-do**, respectably.

.. _option_-e:

Data record pattern matching: The **-e** option
-----------------------------------------------

Modules that read ASCII tables will normally process all the data records
that are read.  The **-e** option offers a built-in pattern scanner that
will only pass records that match the given *pattern* or regular expressions.
The test can also be inverted to only pass data records that *do not* match
the pattern.  The test is *not* applied to header or segment headers.
To reverse the search, i.e., to only accept data records that do *not*
contain the specified pattern, use **-e~**. Should your pattern happen
to start with ~ you will need to escape this character with a backslash
[Default accepts all data records]. For matching data records
against extended `Regular Expressions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>`_,
please enclose the expression in slashes. Append **i** for case-insensitive matching.
To supply a list of such patterns, give **+f**\ *file* with one pattern per line.
To give a single pattern starting with **+f**, escape it with a backslash.

.. _option_-f:

Data type selection: The **-f** option
--------------------------------------

When map projections are not required we must explicitly state what kind
of data each input or output column contains. This is accomplished with
the **-f** option. Following an optional **i** (for input only) or **o**
(for output only), we append a text string with information about each
column (or range of columns) separated by commas. Each string starts
with the column number (0 is first column) followed by either **x**
(longitude), **y** (latitude), **T** (absolute calendar time) or **t**
(relative time). If several consecutive columns have the same format you
may specify a range of columns rather than a single column. Column ranges
must be given in the format *start*\ [:*inc*]:*stop*, where *inc* defaults
to 1 if not specified).  For example, if our input file has geographic
coordinates (latitude, longitude) with absolute calendar coordinates in
the columns 3 and 4, we would specify **fi**\ 0\ **y**,1\ **x**,3:4\ **T**.
All other columns are assumed to
have the default, floating point format and need not be set
individually. The shorthand **-f**\ [**i**\|\ **o**]\ **g**
means **-f**\ [**i**\|\ **o**]0x,1y (i.e., geographic
coordinates). A special use of **-f** is to select **-fp**\ [*unit*],
which *requires* **-J** and lets you use *projected* map coordinates
(e.g., UTM meters) as data input. Such coordinates are automatically
inverted to longitude, latitude during the data import. Optionally,
append a length *unit* (see Table :ref:`distunits <tbl-distunits>`) [meter]. For more
information, see Sections :ref:`input-data-formats` and :ref:`output-data-formats`.

.. _option_-g:

Data gap detection: The **-g** option
-------------------------------------

GMT has several mechanisms that can determine line
segmentation. Typically, data segments are separated by multiple segment
header records (see Chapter :doc:`file_formats`). However, if key data columns contain a
NaN we may also use that information to break lines into multiple
segments. This behavior is modified by the parameter
:term:`IO_NAN_RECORDS` which by default is set to *skip*, meaning such
records are considered bad and simply skipped. If you wish such records
to indicate a segment boundary then set this parameter to *pass*.
Finally, you may wish to indicate gaps based on the data values
themselves. The **-g** option is used to detect gaps based on one or
more criteria (use **-ga** if *all* the criteria must be met; otherwise
only one of the specified criteria needs to be met to signify a data
gap). Gaps can be based on excessive jumps in the *x*- or
*y*-coordinates (**-gx** or **-gy**), or on the distance between points
(**-gd**). Append the *gap* distance and optionally a unit for actual
distances. For geographic data the optional unit may be arc
**d**\ egree, **m**\ inute, and **s**\ econd, or m\ **e**\ ter
[Default], **f**\ eet, **k**\ ilometer, **M**\ iles, or **n**\ autical
miles. For programs that map data to map coordinates you can optionally
specify these criteria to apply to the projected coordinates (by using
upper-case **-gX**, **-gY** or **-gD**). In that case, choose from
**c**\ entimeter, **i**\ nch or **p**\ oint [Default unit is controlled
by :term:`PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT`]. Note: For **-gx** or **-gy** with time data
the unit is instead controlled by :term:`TIME_UNIT`.
Normally, a gap is computed as the absolute value of the
specified distance measure (see above).  Append **+n** to compute the gap
as previous minus current column value and **+p** for current minus previous
column value.

.. _option_-h:

Header data records: The **-h** option
--------------------------------------

The **-h**\ [**i**\|\ **o**][*n*][**+c**][**+d**][**+m**\ *segheader*][**+r**\ *remark*][**+t**\ *title*] option
lets GMT know that input file(s) have *n_recs* header records [0]. If
there are more than one header record you must specify the number after
the **-h** option, e.g., **-h**\ 4. Note that blank lines and records
that start with the character # are *automatically* considered header
records and skipped, hence **-h** is not needed to skip such records.
Thus, *n_recs* refers to general text lines that
do *not* start with # and thus must specifically be skipped in order for
the programs to function properly. The default number of such header
records if **-h** is used is one of the many parameters in the :doc:`/gmt.conf` file
(:term:`IO_N_HEADER_RECS`, by default 0), but can be overridden by
**-h**\ *n_header_recs*. Normally, programs that both read and write
tables will output the header records that are found on input. Use
**-hi** to suppress the writing of header records. You can use the
**-h** options modifiers to tell programs to output extra header
records for titles (**+t**), remarks (**+r**), or column names (**+c**)
identifying each data column, or delete (**+d**) the original headers.
You can even add a single segment header (**+m**) after the initial header
section.

When **-b** is used to indicate binary data the **-h** takes on a
slightly different meaning. Now, the *n_recs* argument is taken to mean
how many *bytes* should be skipped (on input) or padded with the space
character (on output).

.. _option_-i:

Input columns selection: The **-i** option
------------------------------------------

The **-i**\ *columns* option allows you to specify which
input file physical data columns to use and in what order. By default, GMT will
read all the data columns in the file, starting with the first column
(0). Using **-i** modifies that process and reads in a logical record based
on columns from the physical record. For instance, to use the 4th,
7th, and 3rd data column as the required *x,y,z* to
:doc:`/blockmean` you would specify
**-i**\ 3,6,2 (since 0 is the first column). The chosen data columns
will be used as given. Optionally, you can specify that input columns
should be transformed according to a linear or logarithmic conversion.
Do so by appending [**+l**][**+s**\ *scale*][**+o**\ *offset*] to
each column (or range of columns). All items are optional: The **+l**
implies we should first take :math:`\log_{10}` of the data [leave as
is]. Next, we may scale the result by the given *scale* [1]. Finally, we
add in the specified *offset* [0].  If you want the trailing text to remain
part of your subset logical record then you must also select the special column
by requesting column **t**, otherwise we ignore trailing text.  If you only
want to select one word from the trailing text, then append the word number
(0 is the first word).  Finally, to use the entire numerical record and
ignore all trailing text, use **-in**.

.. _gmt_record:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_record.png
   :width: 600 px
   :align: center

   The physical, logical (input) and output record in GMT.  Here, we are
   reading a file with 5 numerical columns plus some free-form text at the
   end.  Our module (here :doc:`/plot`) will be used to plot circles at the
   given locations but we want to assign color based on the ``depth`` column
   (which we need to convert from meters to km) and symbol size based on the
   ``mag`` column (but we want to scale the magnitude by 0.01 to get suitable symbol sizes).
   We use **-i** to pull in the desired columns in the required order and apply
   the scaling, resulting in a logical input record with 4 columns.  The **-f** option
   can be used to specify column types in the logical record if it is not clear
   from the data themselves (such as when reading a binary file).  Finally, if
   a module needs to write out only a portion of the current logical record then
   you may use the corresponding **-o** option to select desired columns, including
   the trailing text column **t**.  If you only want to output one word from the
   trailing text, then append the word number (0 is the first word).  Note that
   these column numbers now refer to the logical record, not the physical, since
   after reading the data there is no physical record, only the logical record in memory.

.. _option_-j_distcalc:

Spherical distance calculations: The **-j** option
--------------------------------------------------

GMT has different ways to compute distances on planetary bodies.
By default (**-jg**) we perform great circle distance calculations, and parameters such
as distance increments or radii will be compared against calculated great
circle distances. To simplify and speed up calculations you can select Flat
Earth mode (**-jf**) instead, which gives an approximate but faster result.  Alternatively,
you can select ellipsoidal (**-je**; i.e., geodesic) mode for the highest precision
(and slowest calculation time).  All spherical distance calculations depend on
the current ellipsoid (:term:`PROJ_ELLIPSOID`), the definition of
the mean radius (:term:`PROJ_MEAN_RADIUS`), and the specification
of latitude type (:term:`PROJ_AUX_LATITUDE`).  Geodesic distance
calculations is also controlled by method (:term:`PROJ_GEODESIC`).

.. _option_-l:

Setting automatic legend entries: The **-l** option
---------------------------------------------------

Map or plot legends are created by :doc:`/legend` and normally this module
will read a *specfile* that outlines how the legend should look.  You can
make very detailed and complicated legends by mixing a variety of items,
such as symbol, free text, colorbars, scales, images, and more.  Yet, for
the vast majority of plots displaying symbols or lines a simple legend will suffice.
The **-l** option is used to automatically build the *specfile* as we plot
the various layers that will make up our illustration.  Apart from setting
the label string that goes with the current symbol or line, you can select
from a series of modifiers that mirror the effect of control codes normally
added to the *specfile* by hand.  For instance, a simple plot with two
symbols can obtain a legend by using this option and modifiers and is shown
in Figure :ref:`Auto Legend <auto_legend>`::

   gmt begin fruit
     gmt plot -R0/7.2/3/7.2 -Jx2c @Table_5_11.txt -Sc0.35c -Glightgreen -Wfaint -lApples+h"LEGEND"+f16p+d
     gmt plot @Table_5_11.txt -St0.35c -Gorange -B -BWStr -lOranges
     gmt legend -DjTR+w3c+o0.25c -F+p1p+ggray95+s
   gmt end show

As the script shows, when no *specfile* is given to :doc:`/legend` then we
look for the automatically generated on in the session directory.

.. _auto_legend:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_autolegend.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Each of the two :doc:`/plot` commands use **-l** to add a symbol to the
   auto legend; the first also sets a legend header of given size and draws a horizontal line.

.. _option_-n:

Grid interpolation parameters: The **-n** option
------------------------------------------------

The **-n**\ *type* option controls parameters used for
2-D grids resampling. You can select the type of spline used (**-nb**
for B-spline smoothing, **-nc** for bicubic [Default], **-nl** for
bilinear, or **-nn** for nearest-node value). For programs that support
it, antialiasing is by default on; optionally, append **+a** to switch
off antialiasing. By default, boundary conditions are set according to
the grid type and extent. Change boundary conditions by appending
**+b**\ *BC*, where *BC* is either **g** for geographic boundary
conditions or one (or both) of **n** and **p** for natural or periodic
boundary conditions, respectively. Append **x** or **y** to only apply
the condition in one dimension. E.g., **-nb+nxpy** would imply natural
boundary conditions in the *x* direction and periodic conditions in the
*y* direction. Finally, append **+t**\ *threshold* to control how close
to nodes with NaN the interpolation should go. A *threshold* of 1.0
requires all (4 or 16) nodes involved in the interpolation to be
non-NaN. 0.5 will interpolate about half way from a non-NaN value; 0.1
will go about 90% of the way, etc.

.. _option_-o:

Output columns selection: The **-o** option
-------------------------------------------

The **-o**\ *columns* option allows you to specify which
columns to write on output and in what order. By default, GMT will
write all the data columns produced by the program. Using **-o**
modifies that process. For instance, to write just the 4th and 2nd data
column to the output you would use **-o**\ 3,1 (since 0 is the first column).
You can also use a column more than once, e.g., **-o**\ 3,1,3, to
duplicate a column on output.  Finally, if your logical record in memory
contains trailing text then you can include that by including the special
column **t** to your selections.  The text is always written after any
numerical columns.  If you only want to output one word from the trailing
text, then append the word number (0 is the first word).  Note that if you
wanted to scale or shift the output values you need to do so during reading,
using the **-i** option. To output all numerical columns and ignoring
trailing text, use **-on**.

.. _option_-p:

Perspective view: The **-p** option
-----------------------------------

All plotting programs that normally produce a flat, two-dimensional
illustration can be told to view this flat illustration from a
particular vantage point, resulting in a perspective view. You can
select perspective view with the **-p** option by setting the azimuth
and elevation of the viewpoint [Default is 180/90]. When **-p** is used
in consort with **-Jz** or **-JZ**, a third value can be appended which
indicates at which *z*-level all 2-D material, like the plot frame, is
plotted (in perspective) [Default is at the bottom of the z-axis].
For frames used for animation, we fix the center of your data domain.
Specify another center using a particular world coordinate point with **+w**\ *lon0*/\ *lat0*\ [/*z0*],
which will project to the center of your page size, or specify the coordinates of
the projected 2-D view point with **+v**\ *x0/y0*. When **-p** is used without any further
arguments, the values from the last use of **-p** in a previous
GMT command will be used.  Alternatively, you can perform a simple rotation
about the z-axis by just giving the rotation angle.  Optionally, use **+v**
or **+w** to select another axis location than the plot origin.

.. _option_-q:

Data row selection: The **-q** option
-------------------------------------

Similar to how **-i** and **-o** control which data *columns* to read and write, the **-qi** (or just **-q**)
and **-qo** options control which data *rows* to read and write [Default is all]. As for columns, you
can specify specific rows, a range of rows, or several sets of row ranges. You can also
invert your selections with a leading ~ and then we select all the rows *not* specified by
your ranges.  Normally, the row counter starts at 0 and increases until the end of the
data set (**+a**).  However, you can append **+f** to reset the counter at the start of each
table (file) or **+s** to reset the counter at the start of each data segment. Thus, **-q**\ 1\ **+s**
will only read the 2nd data record from each of the segments found.  Note that header records do not
increase the row counters; only data records do.  Instead of rows you may specify data
*limits* for a specified column by appending **+c**\ *col*.  Now, we will only select rows whose
data for the given column *col* lie within the range(s) given by your *min*/*max* limits.  Also
note that when **+c** is used the **+a**\|\ **f**\|\ **s** have no effect.

.. _option_nodereg:

Grid registration: The **-r** option
------------------------------------

All 2-D grids in GMT have their nodes
organized in one of two ways, known as *gridline*- and *pixel*-
registration. The GMT default is gridline registration; programs that
allow for the creation of grids can use the **-r** option (or **-rp**) to select
pixel registration instead.  Most observed data tend to be in gridline
registration while processed data sometime may be distributed in
pixel registration.  While you may convert between the two registrations
this conversion looses the Nyquist frequency and dampens the other
high frequencies.  It is best to avoid any registration conversion if you
can help it.  Planning ahead may be important.

Gridline registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this registration, the nodes are centered on the grid line
intersections and the data points represent the average value in a cell
of dimensions (:math:`x_{inc} \cdot y_{inc}`) centered on each node
(left side of Figure :ref:`Grid registration <Grid_registration>`).
In the case of grid line registration the number of nodes are related
to region and grid spacing by

.. math::

   \begin{array}{ccl}
   nx & =  &       (x_{max} - x_{min}) / x_{inc} + 1       \\
   ny & =  &       (y_{max} - y_{min}) / y_{inc} + 1
   \end{array}

which for the example in left side of Figure :ref:`Gridline registration
<Grid_registration>` yields nx = ny = 4.

Pixel registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, the nodes are centered in the grid cells, i.e., the areas
between grid lines, and the data points represent the average values
within each cell (right side of Figure :ref:`Grid registration
<Grid_registration>`). In the case of
pixel registration the number of nodes are related to region and grid
spacing by

.. _Grid_registration:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_registration.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Gridline- and pixel-registration of data nodes.  The red shade indicates the
   areas represented by the value at the node (solid circle).


.. math::

   \begin{array}{ccl}
   nx & =  &       (x_{max} - x_{min}) / x_{inc}   \\
   ny & =  &       (y_{max} - y_{min}) / y_{inc}
   \end{array}

Thus, given the same region (**-R**) and grid spacing, the
pixel-registered grids have one less column and one less row than the
gridline-registered grids; here we find nx = ny = 3.

.. _option_-s:

NaN-record treatment: The **-s** option
---------------------------------------

We can use this option to suppress output for records whose *z*-value
equals NaN (by default we output all records). Alternatively, append
**+r** to reverse the suppression, i.e., only output the records whose
*z*-value equals NaN. Use **-s+a** to suppress output records where one
or more fields (and not necessarily *z*) equal NaN. Finally, you can
supply a comma-separated list of all columns or column ranges to
consider (before the optional modifiers) for this NaN test.

.. _option_-t:

Layer transparency: The **-t** option
-------------------------------------

While the PostScript language does not support transparency, PDF does,
and via PostScript extensions one can manipulate the transparency
levels of objects. The **-t** option allows you to change the
transparency level for the current overlay by appending a percentage in
the 0-100 range; the default is 0, or opaque. Transparency may also be
controlled on a feature by feature basis when setting color or fill (see
section :ref:`-Gfill_attrib`).  Finally, the modules
:doc:`/plot`, :doc:`/plot3d`, and :doc:`/text` can all change transparency
on a record-by-record basis if **-t** is given without argument and the
input file supplies variable transparencies as the last numerical column value.

.. _option_-x_core:

Selecting number of CPU cores: The **-x** option
------------------------------------------------

Specify the number of active cores to be used in any OpenMP-enabled
multi-threaded algorithms. By default, we try to use all available cores.
You may append *n* to only use *n* cores (if *n* is too large it will be truncated
to the maximum number of cores available).  Finally, give a negative *n* to select
all - *n*) cores (but at least one if *n* equals or exceeds all).  The **-x**
option is only available to GMT modules compiled with OpenMP support, with
the exception of :doc:`/movie` which handles its own parallel execution.

.. _option_colon:

Latitude/Longitude or Longitude/Latitude?: The **-:** option
------------------------------------------------------------

For geographical data, the first column is expected to contain
longitudes and the second to contain latitudes. To reverse this
expectation you must apply the **-:** option. Optionally, append **i**
or **o** to restrict the effect to input or output only. Note that
command line arguments that may take geographic coordinates (e.g.,
**-R**) *always* expect longitude before latitude. Also, geographical
grids are expected to have the longitude as first (minor) dimension.

.. [11]
   The Gregorian Calendar is a revision of the Julian Calendar which was
   instituted in a papal bull by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. The reason
   for the calendar change was to correct for drift in the dates of
   significant religious observations (primarily Easter) and to prevent
   further drift in the dates. The important effects of the change were
   (a) Drop 10 days from October 1582 to realign the Vernal Equinox with
   21 March, (b) change leap year selection so that not all years ending
   in "00" are leap years, and (c) change the beginning of the year to 1
   January from 25 March. Adoption of the new calendar was essentially
   immediate within Catholic countries. In the Protestant countries,
   where papal authority was neither recognized not appreciated,
   adoption came more slowly. England finally adopted the new calendar
   in 1752, with eleven days removed from September. The additional day
   came because the old and new calendars disagreed on whether 1700 was
   a leap year, so the Julian calendar had to be adjusted by one more
   day.

   While UTM coordinates clearly refer to points on the Earth, in this
   context they are considered "other". Thus, when we refer to
   "geographical" coordinates herein we imply longitude, latitude.
