Annotation of Contours and "Quoted Lines"
=========================================

The GMT programs :doc:`/grdcontour` (for
data given as 2-dimensional grids) and
:doc:`/contour` (for *x,y,z* tables) allow
for contouring of data sets, while :doc:`/plot`
and :doc:`/plot3d` can plot lines based on *x,y*-
and *x,y,z*-tables, respectively. In both cases it may be necessary to
attach labels to these lines. Clever or optimal placements of labels is
a very difficult topic, and GMT provides several algorithms for this
placement as well as complete freedom in specifying the attributes of
the labels. Because of the richness of these choices we present this
Chapter which summarizes the various options and gives several examples
of their use.

Label Placement
---------------

While the previous GMT versions 1–3 allowed for a single algorithm
that determined where labels would be placed, GMT 4 allows for five
different algorithms. Furthermore, a new "symbol" option (**-Sq** for
"quoted line") has been added to :doc:`/plot` and
:doc:`/plot3d` and hence the new label placement
mechanisms apply to those programs as well. The contouring programs
expect the algorithm to be specified as arguments to **-G** while the
line plotting programs expect the same arguments to follow **-Sq**. The
information appended to these options is the same in both cases and is
of the form [**code**]\ *info*. The five algorithms correspond to the
five codes below (some codes will appear in both upper and lower case;
they share the same algorithm but differ in some other ways). In what
follows, the phrase "line segment" is taken to mean either a contour or
a line to be labeled. The codes are:

**d**:
    Full syntax is
    **d**\ *dist*\ [**c**\|\ **i**\|\ **p**][/\ *frac*].
    Place labels according to the distance measured along the projected
    line on the map. Append the unit you want to measure distances in
    [Default is taken from :term:`PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT`]. Starting at the
    beginning of a line, place labels every *dist* increment of distance
    along the line. To ensure that closed lines whose total length is
    less than *dist* get annotated, we may append *frac* which will
    place the first label at the distance *d = dist*
    :math:`\times` *frac* from the start of a closed line (and every
    *dist* thereafter). If not given, *frac* defaults to 0.25.

**D**:
    Full syntax is
    **D**\ *dist*\ [**d**\|\ **m**\|\ **s**\|\ **e**\|\ **f**\|\ **k**\|\ **M**\|\ **n**][/\ *frac*].
    This option is similar to **d** except the original data must be
    referred to geographic coordinates (and a map projection must have
    been chosen) and actual Earth [36]_ surface distances along the
    lines are considered. Append the unit you want to measure distances
    in; choose among arc **d**\ egree, **m**\ inute, and **s**\ econd,
    or m\ **e**\ ter [Default], **f**\ eet, **k**\ ilometer, statute
    **M**\ iles, or **n**\ autical miles. Other aspects are similar to
    code **d**.

**f**:
    Full syntax is
    **f**\ *fix.txt*\ [/*slop*\ [**c**\|\ **i**\|\ **p**]].
    Here, an ASCII file *fix.txt* is given which must contain records
    whose first two columns hold the coordinates of points along the
    lines at which locations the labels should be placed. Labels will
    only be placed if the coordinates match the line coordinates to
    within a distance of *slop* (append unit or we use
    :term:`PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT`). The default *slop* is zero, meaning only
    exact coordinate matches will do.

**l**:
    Full syntax is **l**\ *line1*\ [,\ *line2*\ [, ...]]. One or more
    straight line segments are specified separated by commas, and labels
    will be placed at the intersections between these lines and our line
    segments. Each *line* specification implies a *start* and *stop*
    point, each corresponding to a coordinate pair. These pairs can be
    regular coordinate pairs (i.e., longitude/latitude separated by a
    slash), or they can be two-character codes that refer to
    predetermined points relative to the map region. These codes are
    taken from the :doc:`/text` justification keys
    [**L**\|\ **C**\|\ **R**][**B**\|\ **M**\|\ **T**]
    so that the first character determines the *x*-coordinate and
    the second determines the *y*-coordinate. In
    :doc:`/grdcontour`, you can also use
    the two codes **Z+** and **Z-** as shorthands for the location of
    the grid's global maximum and minimum, respectively. For example,
    the *line* **LT**/**RB** is a diagonal from the upper left to the
    lower right map corner, while **Z-**/135W/15S is a line from the
    grid minimum to the point (135ºW, 15ºS).

**L**:
    Same as **l** except we will treat the lines given as great circle
    start/stop coordinates and fill in the points between before looking
    for intersections.  You must make sure not to give antipodal start and
    stop coordinates since the great circle path would be undefined.

**n**:
    Full syntax is
    **n**\ *number*\ [/*minlength*\ [**c**\|\ **i**\|\ **p**]].
    Place *number* of labels along each line regardless of total line
    length. The line is divided into *number* segments and the labels
    are placed at the centers of these segments. Optionally, you may
    give a *minlength* distance to ensure that no labels are placed
    closer than this distance to its neighbors.

**N**:
    Full syntax is
    **N**\ *number*\ [/*minlength*\ [**c**\|\ **i**\|\ **p**]].
    Similar to code **n** but here labels are placed at the ends of each
    segment (for *number* >= 2). A special case arises for
    *number = 1* when a single label will be placed according to
    the sign of *number*: -1 places one label justified at the
    start of the line, while +1 places one label justified at
    the end of the line.

**s**:
    Similar to **n** but splits input lines into a series of two-point
    line segments first.  The rest of the algorithm them operates on
    these sets of lines.  This code (and **S**) are specific to
    quoted lines.

**S**:
    Similar to **N** but with the modification described for **s**.

**x**:
    Full syntax is **x**\ *cross.d*. Here, an ASCII file *cross.d* is a
    multi-segment file whose lines will intersect our segment lines;
    labels will be placed at these intersections.

**X**:
    Same as **x** except we treat the lines given as great circle
    start/stop coordinates and fill in the points between before looking
    for intersections.

Only one algorithm can be specified at any given time.

Label Attributes
----------------

Determining where to place labels is half the battle. The other half is
to specify exactly what are the attributes of the labels. It turns out
that there are quite a few possible attributes that we may want to
control, hence understanding how to specify these attributes becomes
important. In the contouring programs, one or more attributes may be
appended to the **-A** option using the format +\ *code*\ [*args*] for
each attribute, whereas for the line plotting programs these attributes
are appended to the **-Sq** option following a colon (:) that separates
the label codes from the placement algorithm. Several of the attributes
do not apply to contours so we start off with listing those that apply
universally. These codes are:

**+a**:
    Controls the angle of the label relative to the angle of the line.
    Append **n** for normal to the line, give a fixed *angle* measured
    counter-clockwise relative to the horizontal. or append **p** for
    parallel to the line [Default]. If using
    :doc:`/grdcontour` the latter option
    you may further append **u** or **d** to get annotations whose upper
    edge always face the next higher or lower contour line.

**+c**:
    Surrounding each label is an imaginary label "textbox" which defines
    a region in which no segment lines should be visible. The initial
    box provides an exact fit to the enclosed text but clearance may be
    extended in both the horizontal and vertical directions (relative to
    the label baseline) by the given amounts. If these should be
    different amounts please separate them by a slash; otherwise the
    single value applies to both directions. Append the distance units
    of your choice (**c\|\ i\|\ m\|\ p**), or
    give % to indicate that the clearance should be this fixed
    percentage of the label font size in use. The default is 15%.

**+d**:
    Debug mode. This is useful when testing contour placement as it will
    draw the normally invisible helper lines and points in the label
    placement algorithms above.

**+e**:
    Delayed mode, to delay the plotting of the text as text clipping is set instead.

**+f**:
    Specifies the desired label font, including size or color. See
    :doc:`/text` for font names or numbers.
    The default font is given by :term:`FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY`.

**+g**:
    Selects opaque rather than the default transparent text boxes. You
    may optionally append the color you want to fill the label boxes;
    the default is the same as :term:`PS_PAGE_COLOR`.

**+j**:
    Selects the justification of the label relative to the placement
    points determined above. Normally this is center/mid justified
    (**CM** in :doc:`/text` justification
    parlance) and this is indeed the default setting. Override by using
    this option and append another justification key code from
    [**L**\|\ **C**\|\ **R**][**B**\|\ **M**\|\ **T**].
    Note for curved text (**+v**) only vertical justification will be
    affected.

**+o**:
    Request a rounded, rectangular label box shape; the default is
    rectangular. This is only manifested if the box is filled or
    outlined, neither of which is implied by this option alone (see
    **+g** and **+p**). As this option only applies to straight text, it
    is ignored if **+v** is given.

**+p**:
    Selects the drawing of the label box outline; append your preferred
    *pen* unless you want the default GMT pen [0.25p,black].

**+r**:
    Do *not* place labels at points along the line whose local radius of
    curvature falls below the given threshold value. Append the radius
    unit of your choice (**c**\|\ **i**\|\ **p**) [Default is 0].

**+u**:
    Append the chosen *unit* to the label. Normally a space will
    separate the label and the unit. If you want to close this gap,
    append a *unit* that begins with a hyphen (-). If you are contouring
    with :doc:`/grdcontour` and you specify
    this option without appending a unit, the unit will be taken from
    the *z*-unit attribute of the grid header.

**+v**:
    Place curved labels that follow the wiggles of the line segments.
    This is especially useful if the labels are long relative to the
    length-scale of the wiggles. The default places labels on an
    invisible straight line at the angle determined.

**+w**:
    The angle of the line at the point of straight label placement is
    calculated by a least-squares fit to the *width* closest points. If
    not specified, *width* defaults to 10.

**+=**:
    Similar in most regards to **+u** but applies instead to a label
    *prefix* which you must append.

For contours, the label will be the value of the contour (possibly
modified by **+u** or **+=**). However, for quoted lines other options apply:

**+l**:
    Append a fixed *label* that will be placed at all label locations.
    If the label contains spaces you must place it inside matching
    quotes.

**+L**:
    Append a code *flag* that will determine the label. Available codes
    are:

    **+Lh**:
        Take the label from the current multi-segment header (hence it
        is assumed that the input line segments are given in the
        multi-segment file format; if not we pick the single label from
        the file's header record). We first scan the header for an
        embedded **-L**\ *label* option; if none is found we instead use
        the first word following the segment marker [>].

    **+Ld**:
        Take the Cartesian plot distances along the line as the label;
        append **c**\|\ **i**\|\ **p** as the unit [Default is
        :term:`PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT`]. The label will be formatted according
        to the :term:`FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT` string, *unless* label placement
        was determined from map distances along the segment lines, in
        which case we determine the appropriate format from the distance
        value itself.

    **+LD**:
        Calculate actual Earth surface distances and use the distance at
        the label placement point as the label; append
        **d**\|\ **e**\|\ **f**\|\ **k**\|\ **m**\|\ **M**\|\ **n**\|\ **s**
        to specify the unit [If not given we default to **d**\ egrees,
        *unless* label placement was determined from map distances along
        the segment lines, in which case we use the same unit specified
        for that algorithm]. Requires a map projection to be used.

    **+Lf**:
        Use all text after the 2nd column in the fixed label location
        file *fix.txt* as labels. This choice obviously requires the
        fixed label location algorithm (code **f**) to be in effect.

    **+Ln**:
        Use the running number of the current multi-segment as label.

    **+LN**:
        Use a slash-separated combination of the current file number and
        the current multi-segment number as label.

    **+Lx**:
        As **h** but use the multi-segment headers in the *cross.d* file
        instead. This choice obviously requires the crossing segments
        location algorithm (code **x\|\ X**) to be in effect.

Examples of Contour Label Placement
-----------------------------------

We will demonstrate the use of these options with a few simple examples.
First, we will contour a subset of the global geoid data used in
Example :ref:`example_01`; the region selected encompasses the world's strongest
"geoid dipole": the Indian Low and the New Guinea High.

Equidistant labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our first example uses the default placement algorithm. Because of the
size of the map we request contour labels every 1.5 inches along the
lines:


.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_App_O_1.txt

As seen in Figure :ref:`Contour label 1 <Contour_label_1>`, the contours are
placed rather arbitrary. The string of contours for -40 to
60 align well but that is a fortuitous consequence of reaching
the 1.5 inch distance from the start at the bottom of the map.

.. _Contour_label_1:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_1.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Equidistant contour label placement with **-Gd**, the only algorithm
   available in previous GMT versions.


Fixed number of labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now exercise the option for specifying exactly how many labels each
contour line should have:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_App_O_2.txt

By selecting only one label per contour and requiring that labels only
be placed on contour lines whose length exceed 1 inch, we achieve the
effect shown in Figure :ref:`Contour label 2 <Contour_label_2>`.

.. _Contour_label_2:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_2.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Placing one label per contour that exceed 1 inch in length, centered on the segment with **-Gn**.


Prescribed label placements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, we specify four points where we would like contour labels to be
placed. Our points are not exactly on the contour lines so we give a
nonzero "slop" to be used in the distance calculations: The point on the
contour closest to our fixed points and within the given maximum
distance will host the label.

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_App_O_3.txt

The angle of the label is evaluated from the contour line geometry, and
the final result is shown in Figure :ref:`Contour label 3 <Contour_label_3>`.
To aid in understanding the algorithm we chose to specify "debug" mode
(**+d**) which placed a small circle at each of the fixed points.

.. _Contour_label_3:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_3.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Four labels are positioned on the points along the contours that are
   closest to the locations given in the file fix.txt in the **-Gf** option.


Label placement at simple line intersections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often, it will suffice to place contours at the imaginary intersections
between the contour lines and a well-placed straight line segment. The
**-Gl** or **-GL** algorithms work well in those cases:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_App_O_4.txt

The obvious choice in this example is to specify a great circle between
the high and the low, thus placing all labels between these extrema.

.. _Contour_label_4:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_4.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Labels are placed at the intersections between contours and the great circle specified in the **-GL** option.


The thin debug line in Figure :ref:`Contour label 4 <Contour_label_4>` shows
the great circle and the intersections where labels are plotted. Note
that any number of such lines could be specified; here we are content
with just one.

Label placement at general line intersections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If (1) the number of intersecting straight line segments needed to pick
the desired label positions becomes too large to be given conveniently
on the command line, or (2) we have another data set or lines whose
intersections we wish to use, the general crossing algorithm makes more
sense:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_App_O_5.txt

.. _Contour_label_5:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_5.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Labels are placed at the intersections between contours and the
   multi-segment lines specified in the **-GX** option.


In this case, we have created three strands of lines whose intersections
with the contours define the label placements, presented in
Figure :ref:`Contour label 5 <Contour_label_5>`.

Examples of Label Attributes
----------------------------

We will now demonstrate some of the ways to play with the label
attributes. To do so we will use :doc:`/plot` on
a great-circle line connecting the geoid extrema, along which we have
sampled the ETOPO5 relief data set. The file thus contains *lon, lat,
dist, geoid, relief*, with distances in km.

Label placement by along-track distances, 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example will change the orientation of labels from along-track to
across-track, and surrounds the labels with an opaque, outlined text box
so that the label is more readable. We choose the place the labels every
1000 km along the line and use that distance as the label. The labels
are placed normal to the line:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_App_O_6.txt

.. _Contour_label_6:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_6.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Labels attributes are controlled with the arguments to the **-Sq** option.


The composite illustration in Figure :ref:`Contour label 6 <Contour_label_6>`
shows the new effects. Note that the line connecting the extrema does
not end exactly at the ‘-' and ‘+' symbols. This is because the
placements of those symbols are based on the mean coordinates of the
contour and not the locations of the (local or global) extrema.

Label placement by along-track distances, 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A small variation on this theme is to place the labels parallel to the
line, use spherical degrees for placement, append the degree symbol as a
unit for the labels, choose a rounded rectangular text box, and
inverse-video the label:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_App_O_7.txt

The output is presented as Figure :ref:`Contour label 7 <Contour_label_7>`.

.. _Contour_label_7:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_7.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Another label attribute example.


Using a different data set for labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the next example we will use the bathymetry values along the transect
as our label, with placement determined by the distance along track. We
choose to place labels every 1500 km. To do this we need to pull out
those records whose distances are multiples of 1500 km and create a
"fixed points" file that can be used to place labels and specify the
labels. This is done with **awk**.

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_App_O_8.txt

The output is presented as Figure :ref:`Contour label 8 <Contour_label_8>`.

.. _Contour_label_8:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_8.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Labels based on another data set (here bathymetry) while the placement is based on distances.


Putting it all together
-----------------------

Finally, we will make a more complex composite illustration that uses
several of the label placement and label attribute settings discussed in
the previous sections. We make a map showing the tsunami travel times
(in hours) from a hypothetical catastrophic landslide in the Canary
Islands [37]_. We lay down a color map based on the travel times and the
shape of the seafloor, and travel time contours with curved labels as
well as a few quoted lines. The final script is

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_App_O_9.txt

with the complete illustration presented as Figure
:ref:`Contour label 9 <Contour_label_9>`.

.. _Contour_label_9:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_9.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Tsunami travel times from the Canary Islands to places in the Atlantic,
   in particular New York. Should a catastrophic landslide occur it is possible
   that New York will experience a large tsunami about 8 hours after the event.

.. [36]
   or whatever planet we are dealing with.

.. [37]
   Travel times were calculated using Geoware's travel time calculator,
   **ttt**; see `<http://www.geoware-online.com/>`_.
