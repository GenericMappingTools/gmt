The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) could not have been designed without
the generous support of several people. The Founders (Wessel and Smith)
gratefully acknowledge A. B.
Watts and the late W. F. Haxby for supporting their efforts on the
original version 1.0 while they were their graduate students at
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Doug Shearer and Roger Davis patiently
answered many questions over e-mail. The subroutine ``gauss`` was
written and supplied by Bill Menke. Further development of versions
2.0–2.1 at SOEST would not have been possible without the support from
the HIGP/SOEST Post-Doctoral Fellowship program to Paul Wessel. Walter
H. F. Smith gratefully acknowledges the generous support of the C. H.
and I. M. Green Foundation for Earth Sciences at the Institute of
Geophysics and Planetary Physics, Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
University of California at San Diego. GMT series 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x
owe their existence to grants EAR-93-02272, OCE-95-29431, OCE-00-82552,
OCE-04-52126, and OCE-1029874 from the National Science Foundation,
which we gratefully acknowledge.

We would also like to acknowledge feedback, suggestions and bug reports
from Michael Barck, Manfred Brands, Allen Cogbill, Stephan Eickschen,
Ben Horner-Johnson, John Kuhn, Angel Li, Andrew Macrae, Alex Madon, Ken
McLean, Greg Neumann, Ameet Raval, Georg Schwarz, Richard Signell, Peter
Schmidt, Dirk Stoecker, Eduardo Suárez, Mikhail Tchernychev, Malte
Thoma, David Townsend, Garry Vaughan, William Weibel, and many others,
including their advice on how to make GMT portable to a wide range of
platforms. John Lillibridge and Stephan Eickschen provided the original
Examples :ref:`(11) <example_11>` and :ref:`(32) <example_32>`,
respectively; Hanno von Lom helped resolve early
problems with DLL libraries for Win32; Lloyd Parkes enabled indexed
color images in PostScript; Kurt Schwehr maintains the packages; Wayne
Wilson implemented the full general perspective projection; and William
Yip helped translate GMT to POSIX ANSI C and incorporate netCDF 3. The
SOEST RCF staff (Ross Ishida, Pat Townsend, and Sharon Stahl) provided
valuable help on Linux and web server support.
