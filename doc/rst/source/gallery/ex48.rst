.. _example_48:

(48) Line networks, map embellishments, and curved titles
---------------------------------------------------------

In this example we show how the module :doc:`plot </plot>`
can be used to create a network of lines based on a file with
just the nodes (the siz airports).  We also demonstrate how the
lines can be shortened by (a) a given measure (here 250 km)
and then (b) the length of the added vector heads.  The airspace
closest to each airport is identified as spherical Voronoi
cells by :doc:`sphtriangulate </sphtriangulate>` and filled
with transparent coloring, allowing us to see the seafloor
texture beneath.  Finally,
we add six local spiderweb azimuth/distance gridlines and
set a curved plot title.
