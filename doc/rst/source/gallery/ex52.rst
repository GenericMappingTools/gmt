.. _example_52:

(52) Image and grid manipulation
--------------------------------

This example highlights how GMT can be used to manipulate images
in conjunction with grids, using :doc:`grdmix </grdmix>` (as well
as :doc:`grdmath </grdmath>`).  We start with two geotiff images for the
day (@earth_day) and night (@earth_night) Earth views and compute
a day/night smoothed grid to reflect the state on June 22, 2000
at midnight in Hawaii.  The day/night grid is used to blend between
the two images with :doc:`grdmix </grdmix>`, and we add more life
to the plot by modifying the colors based on intensities computed
from a co-registered DEM.  The final image is then overlaid on an
Earth viewed from a point near Florida.
