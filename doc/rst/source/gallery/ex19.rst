(19) Color patterns on maps
---------------------------

GMT 3.1 introduced color patterns and this examples give a few cases
of how to use this new feature. We make a phony poster that advertises
an international conference on GMT in Honolulu. We use
:doc:`grdmath </grdmath>`, :doc:`makecpt </makecpt>`, and
:doc:`grdimage </grdimage>` to draw pleasing color
backgrounds on maps, and overlay
:doc:`coast </coast>` clip paths to have the
patterns change at the coastlines. The middle panel demonstrates a
simple :doc:`coast </coast>` call where the built-in
pattern # 86 is drawn at 100 dpi but with the black and white pixels
replaced with color combinations. At the same time the ocean is filled
with a repeating image of a circuit board (provides in Sun raster
format). The text GMT in the center is an off-line PostScript file
that was overlaid using :doc:`image </image>`. The
final panel repeats the top panel except that the land and sea images
have changed places.
