.. _example_43:

(43) Robust regression and outlier detection
--------------------------------------------

In this example show how :doc:`gmtregress </gmtregress>` can be used to determine a
robust regression line using *reweighted least squares* and from
this fit we are able to identify outliers with respect to the
main trend.  The result shows dinosaurs were large and dumb,
humans and some monkeys pretty smart, and the rest of the
mammals doing alright. Band shows 99% confidence internal on regression.
