.. _example_41:

(41) Legend with tables
-----------------------

In this example we demonstrate how one can use the tool :doc:`legend </legend>`
to typeset a table within a legend.  It also shows how one would set up
variable-width columns and fill the cells with a background color.

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/ex41.txt
   :language: bash

.. figure:: /_images/ex41.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Illustrate typesetting legends that include tables.
