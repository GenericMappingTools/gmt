.. _anim_08:

(8) One year (2018) of Pacific seismicity events
-----------------------------------------------------

Here we wish to focus on how to plot events, i.e., symbols
that should be visible for a finite (or infinite) timespan
depending on what they represent.  We obtain one year (2018)
of magnitude 5 or higher seismicity and make a daily movie,
highlighting new quakes as they appear and let them shrink and
darken a few days after the event.
