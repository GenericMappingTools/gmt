(44) Map insets
---------------

In this example show how the two modules :doc:`basemap </basemap>`
and :doc:`mapproject </mapproject>` can be used
to place map insets on top of your map.  The map inset is usually
intended for placing a smaller-scale version of the larger geographical
context of your main plot, so that reader unfamiliar with the detailed
map can see what region we are looking at.  While the Australia example
is simplest since we know the inset will be a square map, the Spain
example requires us to compute the dimensions of the inset first, via
:doc:`mapproject </mapproject>`, so that we can determine exact inset dimensions.
