(44) Map insets
---------------

In this example show how  :doc:`inset </inset>` can be used
to place map insets on top of your map.  The map inset is usually
intended for placing a smaller-scale version of the larger geographical
context of your main plot, so that reader unfamiliar with the detailed
map can see what region we are looking at.  The inset module automatically
determines the possible extent of the map hence we simply pass ? for the
unknown map sizes.
