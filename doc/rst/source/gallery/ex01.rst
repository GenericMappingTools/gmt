(1) Contour maps
----------------

We want to create two contour maps of the low order geoid using the
Hammer equal area projection. Our gridded data file is called ``osu91a1f_16.nc`` and
contains a global 1 by 1 gridded geoid (we will see how to make gridded
files later). We would like to show one map centered on Greenwich and
one centered on the dateline. Positive contours should be drawn with a
solid pen and negative contours with a dashed pen. Annotations should
occur for every 50 m contour level, and both contour maps should show
the continents in light brown in the background. Finally, we want a
rectangular frame surrounding the two maps. This is how it is done:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/example_01.txt
   :language: bash

The first command draws a box surrounding the maps. This is followed by
two sequences of :doc:`coast </coast>`, :doc:`grdcontour </grdcontour>`,
:doc:`grdcontour </grdcontour>`. They differ in that the
first is centered on Greenwich; the second on the dateline. We use the
limit option (**-L**) in :doc:`grdcontour </grdcontour>`
to select negative contours only and plot those with a dashed pen, then
positive contours only and draw with a solid pen [Default]. The **-T**
option causes tick marks pointing in the downhill direction to be drawn
on the innermost, closed contours. For the upper panel we also added -
and + to the local lows and highs. You can find this illustration as
