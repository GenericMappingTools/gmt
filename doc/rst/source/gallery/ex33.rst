.. _example_33:

(33) Stacking automatically generated cross-profiles
----------------------------------------------------

The script produces the plot in Figure. Here
we demonstrate how :doc:`grdtrack </grdtrack>` can be
used to automatically create a suite of crossing profiles of uniform
spacing and length and then sample one or more grids along these
profiles; we also use the median stacking option to create a stacked
profile, showed above the map, with the gray area representing the
variations about the stacked median profile.
