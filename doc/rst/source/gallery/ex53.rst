(53) Building subplots and using per-country shading
----------------------------------------------------

This example illustrates two separate effects:

#. How to automate the plotting or a large set of subplot panels
   via a simple loop that picks up panel-specific parameters from
   a configuration file.
3. How to highlight a country using a DEM with darker ambient shading
   outside the country boundaries.

We use the 6 arc-minute global relief file for these plots that shows
topographic relief in an equal-area block of 3000 by 3000 km centered
on one of the dozen most populated cities in the world. Apart from
the metadata for each city, all subplot panels are identical, thus
making a simple loop over the metadata preferable to writing 12
near-identical subplot sections.  **Note**: For optional resolution
you should switch to the 2x2 arc-minute relief data instead.

We use a small table of metadata for the 12 cities obtained from the
full listing at https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities and created
a file with longitude, latitude, population (in millions), ISO-2
country code, and city name.

The example script then reads one line at the time from the metadata
file and creates a DEM map for that city, embellished with a tag
containing the city and the population, while using the ISO-2 country
code to set up a clip path to highlight the relief inside its boundaries.
