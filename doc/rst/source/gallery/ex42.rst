(42) Antarctica and stereographic data
--------------------------------------

In this example we demonstrate how one can use combine Cartesian data for
Antarctica (here the BEDMAP data already projected via a stereographic projection)
with geographic data, all using the same map scale. It also shows how one would set up
minor legends and map scales.
