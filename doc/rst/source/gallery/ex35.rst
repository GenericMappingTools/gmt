.. _example_35:

(35) Spherical triangulation and distance calculations
------------------------------------------------------

The script produces the plot in Figure. Here
we demonstrate how :doc:`sphtriangulate </sphtriangulate>` and
:doc:`sphdistance </sphdistance>` are used to compute the Delauney and
Voronoi information on a sphere, using a decimated GSHHG crude coastline.
We show a color image of the distances, highlighted with 500-km contours,
and overlay the Voronoi polygons in green. Finally, the continents are
placed on top.
