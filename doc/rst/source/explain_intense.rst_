**-I**\ [*ifile*\|\ *intens*\|\ **+a**\ *azimuth*][**+d**][**+m**\ *ambient*][**+n**\ *args*]
    Gives the name of a grid file with intensities in the Â±1 range,
    or a constant *intens* to apply everywhere (affects the ambient light).
    Alternatively, derive intensities from the main data grid via a call
    to :doc:`grdgradient` by appending **+a**\ *azimuth*, **+n**\ *args*
    and **+m**\ *ambient* for the arguments needed by that module, or just
    give **+d** to select the default (**+a**\ -45\ **+nt**\ 1\ **+m**\ 0).
    For more specific intensity scenarios then run :doc:`grdgradient`
    separately first. If we should derive intensities from another file
    than the main grid, specify that file as *ifile* and add suitable modifiers [Default is no
    illumination]. **Note**: If the input grid actually is an image then
    *ifile* or constant *intens* must be provided since derivatives are
    not available.
