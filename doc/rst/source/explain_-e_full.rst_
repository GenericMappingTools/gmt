.. _-e_full:

**-e**\ [**~**]\ *"pattern"* **\|** **-e**\ [**~**]/\ *regexp*/[**i**]
    Only accept ASCII data records that contain the specified pattern.
    To reverse the search, i.e., to only accept data records that do *not*
    contain the specified pattern, use **-e~**. Should your pattern happen
    to start with ~ you will need to escape this character with a backslash
    [Default accepts all data records]. For matching data records
    against extended regular expressions, please enclose the expression in slashes.
    Append **i** for case-insensitive matching.
    To supply a list of such patterns, give **+f**\ *file* with one pattern per line.
    To give a single pattern starting with **+f**, escape it with a backslash.
