.. _core_full:

**-x**\ [[-]\ *n*\ ]
    Limit the number of cores to be used in any OpenMP-enabled
    multi-threaded algorithms. By default we try
    to use all available cores.  Append *n* to only use *n* cores
    (if too large it will be truncated to the maximum cores
    available).  Finally, give a negative *n* to select
    (all - *n*) cores (or at least 1 if *n* equals or exceeds
    all).  The **-x** option is only available to GMT modules
    compiled with OpenMP support.
