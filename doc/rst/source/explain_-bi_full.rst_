The **-bi** option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Syntax**

**-bi**\ *record*\ [**+b**\|\ **l**]
    Select native binary format for primary table input (secondary inputs are always ASCII).

**Description**

Select native binary record format for primary table input. The *record* is one or more groups with
format [*ncols*][*type*][**w**], where *ncols* is the number of consecutive data columns of given
*type* and *type* must be one of:

.. _bi_types:

    - **c** - int8_t (1-byte signed char)
    - **u** - uint8_t (1-byte unsigned char)
    - **h** - int16_t (2-byte signed int)
    - **H** - uint16_t (2-byte unsigned int)
    - **i** - int32_t (4-byte signed int)
    - **I** - uint32_t (4-byte unsigned int)
    - **l** - int64_t (8-byte signed int)
    - **L** - uint64_t (8-byte unsigned int)
    - **f** - 4-byte single-precision float
    - **d** - 8-byte double-precision float [Default]
    - **x** - use to skip *ncols* anywhere in the record

Force byte-swapping of a group by appending **w** at the end of the group.
For records with mixed types, append additional comma-separated groups (no space between groups).
The following modifiers are supported:

    - **+b**\|\ **l** to indicate that the entire data file should be read as big- or little-endian, respectively.

The cumulative number of *ncols* may exceed the columns actually needed by the program. If *ncols* is not specified we
assume that *type* applies to all columns and that *ncols* is implied by the expectation of the program. When using
native binary data the user must be aware of the fact that GMT has no way of determining the actual number of columns
in the file. Native binary files may have a header section, where the :ref:`-h option
<reference/options:Header data records: The **-h** option>` can be used to skip the first *n* bytes. If the input file
is netCDF, no **-b** is needed; simply append **?**\ *var1*\ **/**\ *var2*\ **/**\ *...* to the filename to specify the
variables to be read (see :doc:`/reference/file-formats` and :ref:`Modifiers for COARDS-compliant netCDF files
<modifiers-for-CF>` for more information).

.. toggle::

    Here is an example that writes a binary file and reads it back with the first column 4 byte float, the second
    column 8 byte int, and the third column 8 byte double.

    ::

        echo 1.5 2 2.5 | gmt convert -bo1f,1l,1d > test.bin
        gmt convert test.bin -bi1f,1l,1d
