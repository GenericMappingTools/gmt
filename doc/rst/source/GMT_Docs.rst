Acknowledgments
---------------

The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) could not have been designed without
the generous support of several people. The Founders (Wessel and Smith)
gratefully acknowledge A. B.
Watts and the late W. F. Haxby for supporting their efforts on the
original version 1.0 while they were their graduate students at
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Doug Shearer and Roger Davis patiently
answered many questions over e-mail. The subroutine ``gauss`` was
written and supplied by Bill Menke. Further development of versions
2.0--2.1 at SOEST would not have been possible without the support from
the HIGP/SOEST Post-Doctoral Fellowship program to Paul Wessel. Walter
H. F. Smith gratefully acknowledges the generous support of the C. H.
and I. M. Green Foundation for Earth Sciences at the Institute of
Geophysics and Planetary Physics, Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
University of California at San Diego. GMT series 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x
owe their existence to grants EAR-93-02272, OCE-95-29431, OCE-00-82552,
OCE-04-52126, and OCE-1029874 from the National Science Foundation,
which we gratefully acknowledge.

We would also like to acknowledge feedback, suggestions and bug reports
from Michael Barck, Manfred Brands, Allen Cogbill, Stephan Eickschen,
Ben Horner-Johnson, John Kuhn, Angel Li, Andrew Macrae, Alex Madon, Ken
McLean, Greg Neumann, Ameet Raval, Georg Schwarz, Richard Signell, Peter
Schmidt, Dirk Stoecker, Eduardo Suárez, Mikhail Tchernychev, Malte
Thoma, David Townsend, Garry Vaughan, William Weibel, and many others,
including their advice on how to make GMT portable to a wide range of
platforms. John Lillibridge and Stephan Eickschen provided the original
Examples :ref:`(11) <example_11>` and :ref:`(32) <example_32>`,
respectively; Hanno von Lom helped resolve early
problems with DLL libraries for Win32; Lloyd Parkes enabled indexed
color images in PostScript; Kurt Schwehr maintains the packages; Wayne
Wilson implemented the full general perspective projection; and William
Yip helped translate GMT to POSIX ANSI C and incorporate netCDF 3. The
SOEST RCF staff (Ross Ishida, Pat Townsend, and Sharon Stahl) provided
valuable help on Linux and web server support.

Finally, GMT includes some code supplied by others, in particular the
Triangle code used for Delaunay triangulation. Its author, `Jonathan
Shewchuk <http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/>`_, says

    "If you use Triangle, and especially if you use it to accomplish
    real work, I would like very much to hear from you. A short letter
    or email describing how you use Triangle will
    mean a lot to me. The more people I know are using this program, the
    more easily I can justify spending time on improvements and on the
    three-dimensional successor to Triangle, which in turn will benefit
    you."

A few GMT users take the time to write us letters, telling us of the
difference GMT is making in their work. We appreciate receiving these
letters. On days when we wonder why we ever released GMT we pull these
letters out and read them. Seriously, as financial support for
GMT depends on how well we can "sell" the idea to funding agencies and
our superiors, letter-writing is one area where GMT users can affect
such decisions by supporting the GMT project.

Preface
=======

While GMT has served the map-making and data processing needs of
scientists since 1988 [1]_, the current global use was heralded by the
first official release in *EOS Trans. AGU* in the fall of 1991. Since
then, GMT has grown to become a standard tool for many users,
particularly in the Earth and Ocean Sciences but the global collective
of GMT users is incredibly diverse. Development has at times been
rapid, and numerous releases have seen the light of day since the early
versions. For a detailed history of the changes from release to release,
see file ``ChangeLog`` in the main GMT directory. For a nightly snapshot of ongoing
activity, see the online page. For a historical perspective of the
origins and development of GMT see the video podcast "20 Years with
GMT -- The Generic Mapping Tools" produced following a seminar given by
Paul Wessel on the 20th anniversary of GMT; a link is available on the
GMT website.

The success of GMT is to a large degree due to the input of the user
community. In fact, most of the capabilities and options in the
GMT modules originated as user requests. We would like to hear from
you should you have any suggestions for future enhancements and
modification. Please send your comments to the GMT help list or create
an issue in the bug tracker
(see `<http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/issues/>`_).

.. _command-line-completion:

Command-line completion
-----------------------

GMT provides basic command-line completion (tab completion) for bash.
The easiest way to use the feature is to install the
`bash-completion <http://bash-completion.alioth.debian.org/>`_ package
which is available in many operating system distributions.

Depending on the distribution, you may still need to source it from
``~/.bashrc``, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Use bash-completion, if available
   if [ -r /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
     . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
   fi

When you install GMT from a distribution package, the completion rules
are installed in ``/etc/bash_completion.d/gmt`` and loaded automatically.
Custom GMT builds provide ``<prefix>/share/tools/gmt_completion.bash``
which needs to be manually sourced from either ``~/.bash_completion`` or
``~/.bashrc``.

Mac users should note that bash-completion >=2.0 requires bash >=4.1.
However, OS X won't ship anything that's licensed under GPL version 3.
The last version of bash available under the GPLv2 is 3.2 from 2006.
It is recommended that *bash-completion* is installed together with
*bash* via `MacPorts <http://www.macports.org/>`_,
`Fink <http://finkproject.org/>`_, or `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_.
You then need to change the shell used by your terminal application.
The `bash-completion HOWTO from MacPorts
<http://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/bash-completion>`_
explains how to change the preferences of Terminal.app and iTerm.app.
Another way is to change the default shell by editing of the user
database:

.. code-block:: bash

   Add /opt/local/bin/bash to /etc/shells
   chsh -s /opt/local/bin/bash

Modify the path to bash, ``/opt/local/bin/bash``, in the example above
accordingly.


Introduction
============

Historical overview
-------------------

Most scientists are familiar with the sequence: *raw data* →
*processing* → *final illustration*.
In order to finalize papers for submission to scientific journals,
prepare proposals, and create illustrations for various
presentations, many scientists spend large amounts of time and money to
create high-quality figures. This process can be tedious and is often
done manually, since available commercial or in-house software usually
can do only part of the job. To expedite this process we introduce the
Generic Mapping Tools (GMT for short), which is a free [2]_ software
package that can be used to manipulate columns of tabular data,
time-series, and gridded data sets, and display these data in a variety
of forms ranging from simple *x*--*y* plots to maps and color-coded,
perspective, and shaded-relief illustrations. GMT uses the
PostScript page description language [*Adobe Systems Inc.*, 1990].
With PostScript, multiple plot files can easily be superimposed to
create arbitrarily complex images in gray tones or full color.
Line drawings, bitmapped images, and text can be easily combined in one
illustration. PostScript plot files are device-independent: The same
file can be printed at 300 dots per inch (dpi) on a cheap
printer or converted to a high-resolution PNG image for online usage.
GMT software is written as a set of UNIX tools [3]_ and is
totally self-contained and fully documented. The system is offered free
of charge and is distributed over the Internet
[*Wessel and Smith, 1991; 1995; 1998*; *Wessel et al., 2013*].  The
PostScript plots are easily converted to other formats, such as PDF
or any raster image [4]_.

The original version 1.0 of GMT was released in the summer of 1988
when the authors were graduate students at Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University. During our tenure as graduate
students, LDEO changed its computing environment to a distributed
network of UNIX workstations, and we wrote GMT to run in this
environment. It became a success at LDEO, and soon spread to numerous
other institutions in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan. The current
version benefits from the many suggestions contributed by users of the
earlier versions, and now includes more than 100 tools, more than 30
projections, and many other new, more flexible features. GMT provides
scientists with a variety of tools for data manipulation and display,
including routines to sample, filter, compute spectral estimates, and
determine trends in time series, grid or triangulate arbitrarily spaced
data, perform mathematical operations (including filtering) on 2-D data
sets both in the space and frequency domain, sample surfaces along
arbitrary tracks or onto a new grid, calculate volumes, and find trend
surfaces. The plotting programs will let the user make linear,
log\ :math:`_{10}`, and :math:`x^a - y^b` diagrams, polar
and rectangular histograms, maps with filled continents and coastlines
choosing from many common map projections, contour plots, mesh plots,
monochrome or color images, and artificially illuminated shaded-relief
and 3-D perspective illustrations.

GMT is written in the highly portable ANSI C programming language
[*Kernighan and Ritchie*, 1988], is fully POSIX compliant [*Lewine*,
1991], and may be used with any hardware
running some flavor of UNIX. In
writing GMT, we have followed the modular design philosophy of UNIX:
The *raw data* → *processing* → *final illustration* flow is broken
down to a series of elementary steps; each
step is accomplished by a separate GMT or UNIX tool. This modular
approach brings several benefits: (1) only a few programs are needed,
(2) each program is small and easy to update and maintain, (3) each step
is independent of the previous step and the data type and can therefore
be used in a variety of applications, and (4) the programs can be
chained together in shell scripts or with pipes, thereby creating a
process tailored to do a user-specific task. The decoupling of the data
retrieval step from the subsequent massage and plotting is particularly
important, since each institution will typically have its own data base
formats. To use GMT with custom data bases, one has only to write a
data extraction tool which will put out data in a form readable by
GMT (discussed below). After writing the extractor, all other
GMT modules will work as they are.

GMT is thoroughly documented and comes with a technical reference and
cookbook which explains the purpose of the package and its many
features, and provides numerous examples to help new users quickly
become familiar with the operation and philosophy of the system. The
cookbook contains the shell scripts that were used for each example;
PostScript files of each illustration are also provided. All programs
have individual manual pages which can be installed as part of the
on-line documentation under the UNIX **man** utility or as web
pages. In addition, the programs offer friendly help messages which make
them essentially self-teaching -- if a user enters invalid or ambiguous
command arguments, the program will print a warning to the screen with a
synopsis of the valid arguments. All the documentation is available for
web browsing and may be installed at the user's site.

The processing and display routines within GMT are completely general
and will handle any (*x,y*) or (*x,y,z*) data as input. For many
purposes the (*x,y*) coordinates will be (longitude, latitude) but in
most cases they could equally well be any other variables (e.g.,
wavelength, power spectral density). Since the GMT plot tools will
map these (*x,y*) coordinates to positions on a plot or map using a
variety of transformations (linear, log-log, and several map
projections), they can be used with any data that are given by two or
three coordinates. In order to simplify and standardize input and
output, by default GMT uses two file formats only. Arbitrary sequences of (*x,y*)
or (*x,y,z*) data are read from multi-column ASCII tables, i.e., each
file consists of several records, in which each coordinate is confined
to a separate column [5]_. This format is straightforward and allows the
user to perform almost any simple (or complicated) reformatting or
processing task using GMT processing tools (and in a pinch standard UNIX utilities such as **cut**,
**paste**, **grep**, **sed** and **awk**). Two-dimensional data
that have been sampled on an equidistant grid are read and written by
GMT in a binary grid file using the functions provided with the netCDF
library (a free, public-domain software library available separately
from UCAR, the University Corporation of Atmospheric Research [*Treinish
and Gough*, 1987]). This XDR (External Data Representation) based format
is architecture independent, which allows the user to transfer the
binary data files from one computer system to another [6]_.
GMT contains programs that will read ASCII (*x,y,z*) files and produce
grid files. One such program, :doc:`surface`,
includes new modifications to the gridding algorithm developed by *Smith
and Wessel* [1990] using continuous splines in tension. Optionally, GMT
can also read various binary and netCDF tables, as well as a variety of
grid formats, especially if built with GDAL support.

Most of the programs will produce some form of output, which falls into
four categories. Several of the programs may produce more than one of
these types of output:

*  1-D ASCII Tables — For example, a (*x,y*) series may be
   filtered and the filtered values output. ASCII output is written to
   the standard output stream.

*  2-D binary (netCDF or user-defined) grid files -- Programs that grid
   ASCII (*x,y,z*) data or operate on existing grid files produce
   this type of output.

*  PostScript -- The plotting programs all use the PostScript page
   description language to define plots. These commands are stored as
   ASCII text and can be edited should you want to customize the plot
   beyond the options available in the programs themselves.

*  Reports -- Several GMT programs read input files and report
   statistics and other information. Nearly all programs have an
   optional "verbose" operation, which reports on the progress of
   computation. All programs feature usage messages, which prompt the
   user if incorrect commands have been given. Such text is written to
   the standard error stream and can therefore be separated from ASCII
   table output.

GMT is available over the Internet at no charge. To obtain a copy,
goto GMT home page http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/ and follow instructions.
We also maintain user forums and a bug and feature tracking system on
the same page.

GMT has served a multitude of scientists very well, and their
responses have prompted us to develop these programs even further. It is
our hope that the new version will satisfy these users and attract new
users as well. We present this system to the community in order to
promote sharing of research software among investigators in the US and abroad.

Modern and Classic Mode
-----------------------

For almost three decades, GMT scripts have looked remarkably similar.  The options flags
and the general workflow of adding overlays to existing PostScript files have
remained unchanged, and thousands of GMT scripts written in c-shell, bash shell, DOS batch,
and other environments exist and their maintainers expect them to run in the future.
This requirement of backwards compatibility has to some extent stifled our drive to
make GMT easier and safer to use.  Having run dozens of classes introducing GMT to students
and staff, and helped hundreds of practitioners via email or forums over the years, we
have a pretty clear idea of what is difficult.

Given its almost limitless capabilities, GMT has always had a fairly steep learning curve.
The hardest aspects that have percolated to the top of the "rookie error" list include

#. The GMT "cake-baking": Handling the use of **-O**, **-K**, and **-P** to manage PostScript overlays.
#. The PostScript redirection: Creating a new file versus appending to an existing file.
#. Reusing the current region (**-R**) and projection (**-J**) in multi-step scripts by repeating **-R -J** everywhere.
#. Converting the PostScript plot to more desirable graphic formats, such as PDF.

While pondering these facts, we have also started to gain experience with the MATLAB and Octave
toolboxes and the preliminary design of the Python package. We were noticing that
the resulting scripts looked too much like the GMT shell command-line versions, setting
users up for a continuation of the same rookie errors.
The solution to this conundrum was to introduce different *run* modes:
Starting with GMT 6 we introduce a new operating *mode* for GMT named *modern*.  In contrast
to the *classic* (and only) mode available in earlier versions 1-5, the *modern* mode
was designed to eliminate some of the hardest aspects of learning and using GMT.
Depending on how GMT is started it will either be running in *classic* or *modern* mode.
Classic mode is the GMT scripting in use for decades and it will remain the default mode for
command-line work. The *modern* mode invokes simpler rules that eliminate the possibility
of the listed rookie errors and simplifies scripting considerably across all interfaces.
It also imposes a structure and hence not every single classic script can be represented in
modern mode.  Consequently, modern mode is less flexible but much easier to use, and we expect
it will serve the needs of almost all GMT users.  We strongly encourage new users to use the
modern mode.

To defeat the rookie errors listed above, here are the features of *modern* mode:

#. The **-O**, **-K**, and **P** options have been removed.
#. Modules no longer write PostScript to standard output that the users must manage.
   Instead, they write to hidden temporary files.  Checking the status of these files
   is what allows GMT to know if PostScript should be appended or if we are starting
   a new plot.
#. The *modern* mode runs the entire workflow in a unique temporary directory, hence
   numerous scripts can execute simultaneously without interfering, and we can use
   the gmt.history information to automatically supply missing regions (**-R**) and
   projection (**-J**) arguments.
#. When the workflow ends, the hidden PostScript files are automatically completed
   and converted to the chosen graphics format [Default is PDF for command-line work].
#. Page size is now automatically set regardless of size and properly cropped.

Not only does the new rules remove the greatest obstacles to GMT learning, it greatly
simplifies scripting by eliminating needless repetition of options and output filenames.  The
modern mode is activated and deactivated by the new commands **gmt begin** and **gmt end**,
respectively.  Since these are not part of the classic repertoire one cannot
accidentally execute a classic mode script in modern mode (or vice versa).
We will discuss these two commands later.  Finally, there are some new features in GMT that
are only accessible under modern mode, such as subplots, new ways to specify the map domain, map insets, and to
get multiple output formats from the same plot.

The modern mode relies on know what session is being run. If your script is explicitly or
inadvertently creating sub-shells under UNIX then the script could fail.  If this is the
case then you will need to add
export GMT_SESSION_NAME=<some unique string>
before gmt begin starts the script.

The following is a summary of all the programs supplied with GMT and
a very short description of their purpose. For more details, see the
individual UNIX manual pages or the online web documentation. For a
listing sorted by program purpose, see Section `GMT quick reference`_.

GMT quick reference
-------------------

Instead of an alphabetical listing, this section
contains a summary sorted by program purpose. Also included is a quick
summary of the standard command line options and a breakdown of the
**-J** option for each of the over 30 projections available in GMT.

GMT offers 31 map projections. These are specified using the **-J**
common option. There are two conventions you may use: (a) GMT-style
syntax and (b) **Proj4**\ -style syntax. The projection codes for the
GMT-style are tabulated below.

General Features
================

This section explains features common to all the programs in GMT and
summarizes the philosophy behind the system. Some of the features
described here may make more sense once you reach the cook-book section
where we present actual examples of their use.

GMT units
---------

While GMT has default units for both actual Earth distances and plot
lengths (i.e., dimensions) of maps, it is recommended that you explicitly
indicate the units of your arguments by appending the unit character, as
discussed below. This will aid you in debugging, let others understand your
scripts, and remove any uncertainty as to what unit you thought you wanted.

Distance units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _tbl-distunits:

+---------+-------------------+---------+------------------+
+=========+===================+=========+==================+
| **d**   | Degree of arc     | **M**   | Statute mile     |
+---------+-------------------+---------+------------------+
| **e**   | Meter [Default]   | **n**   | Nautical mile    |
+---------+-------------------+---------+------------------+
| **f**   | Foot              | **s**   | Second of arc    |
+---------+-------------------+---------+------------------+
| **k**   | Kilometer         | **u**   | US Survey foot   |
+---------+-------------------+---------+------------------+
| **m**   | Minute of arc     |         |                  |
+---------+-------------------+---------+------------------+

For Cartesian data and scaling the data units do not normally matter
(they could be kg or Lumens for all we know) and are never entered.
Geographic data are different, as distances can be specified in a variety
of ways. GMT programs that accept actual Earth length scales like
search radii or distances can therefore handle a variety of units. These
choices are listed in Table :ref:`distunits <tbl-distunits>`; simply append the desired
unit to the distance value you supply. A value without a unit suffix
will be consider to be in meters. For example, a distance of 30 nautical
miles should be given as 30\ **n**.

Distance calculations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The calculation of distances on Earth (or other planetary bodies)
depends on the ellipsoidal parameters of the body (via
:ref:`PROJ_ELLIPSOID <PROJ_ELLIPSOID>`) and the method of computation. GMT offers three
alternatives that trade off accuracy and computation time.

Flat Earth distances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Quick, but approximate "Flat Earth" calculations make a first-order
correction for the spherical nature of a planetary body by computing the
distance between two points A and B as

.. math::

	 d_f = R \sqrt{(\theta_A - \theta_B)^2 + \cos \left [ \frac{\theta_A +
	 \theta_B}{2} \right ] \Delta \lambda^2}, \label{eq:flatearth}

where *R* is the representative (or spherical) radius of the
planet, :math:`\theta` is latitude, and the difference in longitudes,
:math:`\Delta \lambda = \lambda_A - \lambda_B`, is adjusted for any
jumps that might occur across Greenwich or the Dateline. As written, the
geographic coordinates are given in radians. This approach is suitable
when the points you use to compute :math:`d_f` do not greatly differ in
latitude and computation speed is paramount. You can specify this mode
of computation by using the **-** prefix to the specified distance (or
to the unit itself in cases where no distance is required and only a
unit is expected). For instance, a search radius of 50 statute miles
using this mode of computation might be specified via **-S-**\ 50\ **M**.

Great circle distances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the default distance calculation, which will also approximate
the planetary body by a sphere of mean radius *R*. However, we
compute an exact distance between two points A and B on such a sphere
via the Haversine equation

.. math::

	 d_g = 2R \sin^{-1}  {\sqrt{\sin^2\frac{\theta_A - \theta_B}{2} + \cos
	 \theta_A \cos \theta_B \sin^2 \frac{\lambda_A - \lambda_B}{2}} },
	 \label{eq:greatcircle}

This approach is suitable for most situations unless exact calculations
for an ellipsoid is required (typically for a limited surface area). For
instance, a search radius of 5000 feet using this mode of computation
would be specified as **-S**\ 5000\ **f**.

Note: There are two additional
GMT defaults that control how
great circle (and Flat Earth) distances are computed. One concerns the
selection of the "mean radius". This is selected by
:ref:`PROJ_MEAN_RADIUS <PROJ_MEAN_RADIUS>`, which selects one of several possible
representative radii. The second is :ref:`PROJ_AUX_LATITUDE <PROJ_AUX_LATITUDE>`, which
converts geodetic latitudes into one of several possible auxiliary
latitudes that are better suited for the spherical approximation. While
both settings have default values to best approximate geodesic distances
(*authalic* mean radius and latitudes), expert users can choose from a
range of options as detailed in the :doc:`gmt.conf` man page.  Note that
these last two settings are only used if the :ref:`PROJ_ELLIPSOID <PROJ_ELLIPSOID>`
is not set to "sphere".

Geodesic distances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the most accurate calculations we use a full ellipsoidal
formulation. Currently, we are using Vincenty's [1975] formula [7]_
which is accurate to 0.5 mm. You
select this mode of computation by using the **+** prefix to the
specified distance (or to the unit itself in cases where no distance is
required). For instance, a search radius of 20 km using this mode of
computation would be set by **-S+**\ 20\ **k**.  You may use the
setting :ref:`PROJ_GEODESIC <PROJ_GEODESIC>` which defaults to
*Vincenty* but may also be set to *Rudoe* for old GMT4-style calculations
or *Andoyer* for an approximate geodesic (within a few tens of meters)
that is much faster to compute.

Length units
~~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT programs can accept dimensional quantities and plot lengths in
**c**\ m, **i**\ nch, or **p**\ oint (1/72 of an inch) [8]_. There are
two ways to ensure that GMT understands which unit you intend to use:

#. Append the desired unit to the dimension you supply. This way is
   explicit and clearly communicates what you intend, e.g.,
   **-X**\ 4\ **c** means the length being passed to the **-X** switch
   is 4 cm.

#. Set the parameter :ref:`PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT <PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT>` to the desired unit. Then,
   all dimensions without explicit unit will be interpreted accordingly.

The latter method is less secure as other users may have a different
unit set and your script may not work as intended. We therefore
recommend you always supply the desired unit explicitly.

GMT defaults
------------

Overview and the gmt.conf file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are almost 150 parameters which can be adjusted individually to
modify the appearance of plots or affect the manipulation of data. When
a program is run, it initializes all parameters to the
GMT\ defaults [9]_, then tries to open the file ``gmt.conf`` in the current
directory [10]_. If not found, it will look for that file in a
sub-directory ``/.gmt`` of your home directory, and finally in your home directory
itself. If successful, the program will read the contents and set the
default values to those provided in the file. By editing this file you
can affect features such as pen thicknesses used for maps, fonts and
font sizes used for annotations and labels, color of the pens,
dots-per-inch resolution of the hardcopy device, what type of spline
interpolant to use, and many other choices. A complete list of all the
parameters and their default values can be found in the
:doc:`gmt.conf` manual pages. Figures
:ref:`GMT Parameters a <gmt_defaults_a>`,
:ref:`b <gmt_defaults_b>`, and
:ref:`c <gmt_defaults_c>` show the parameters that affect
plots. You may create your own ``gmt.conf`` files by running
:doc:`gmtdefaults` and then modify those
parameters you want to change. If you want to use the parameter settings
in another file you can do so by copying that file to the current
directory and call it gmt.conf. This makes it easy to maintain several distinct parameter
settings, corresponding perhaps to the unique styles required by
different journals or simply reflecting font changes necessary to make
readable overheads and slides.  At the end of such scripts you should then
delete the (temporary) gmt.conf file.  Note that any arguments given on the
command line (see below) will take precedent over the default values.
E.g., if your ``gmt.conf`` file has *x* offset = 1\ **i** as default, the
**-X**\ 1.5\ **i** option will override the default and set the offset to 1.5 inches.

.. _gmt_defaults_a:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_Defaults_1a.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Some GMT parameters that affect plot appearance.

.. _gmt_defaults_b:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_Defaults_1b.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   More GMT parameters that affect plot appearance.

.. _gmt_defaults_c:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_Defaults_1c.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Even more GMT parameters that affect plot appearance.

There are at least two good reasons why the GMT default options are
placed in a separate parameter file:

#. It would not be practical to allow for command-line syntax covering
   so many options, many of which are rarely or never changed (such as
   the ellipsoid used for map projections).

#. It is convenient to keep separate ``gmt.conf`` files for specific projects, so
   that one may achieve a special effect simply by running
   GMT commands in the directory whose ``gmt.conf`` file has the desired settings.
   For example, when making final illustrations for a journal article
   one must often standardize on font sizes and font types, etc. Keeping
   all those settings in a separate ``gmt.conf`` file simplifies this process and
   will allow you to generate those illustrations with the same settings
   later on. Likewise, GMT scripts that make figures for PowerPoint
   presentations often use a different color scheme and font size than
   output intended for laser printers. Organizing these various
   scenarios into separate ``gmt.conf`` files will minimize headaches associated with
   micro-editing of illustrations.

Changing GMT defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned, GMT programs will attempt to open a file named  ``gmt.conf``. At
times it may be desirable to override that default. There are several
ways in which this can be accomplished.

*  One method is to start each script by saving a copy of the current  ``gmt.conf``,
   then copying the desired ``gmt.conf`` file to the current directory, and finally
   reverting the changes at the end of the script. Possible side effects
   include premature ending of the script due to user error or bugs
   which means the final resetting does not take place (unless you write
   your script very carefully.)

*  To permanently change some of the GMT parameters on the fly
   inside a script the :doc:`gmtset` utility
   can be used. E.g., to change the primary annotation font to 12 point
   Times-Bold in red we run

   ::

    gmt set FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY 12p,Times-Bold,red

   These changes will remain in effect until they are overridden.

*  If all you want to achieve is to change a few parameters during the
   execution of a single command but otherwise leave the environment
   intact, consider passing the parameter changes on the command line
   via the **-**\ **-**\ *PAR=value* mechanism. For instance, to temporarily
   set the output format for floating points to have lots of decimals,
   say, for map projection coordinate output, append
   **-**\ **-**\ :ref:`FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT <FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT>`\ =%.16lg to the command in question.

*  Finally, GMT provides to possibility to override the settings only
   during the running of a single script, reverting to the original
   settings after the script is run, as if the script was run in
   "isolation". The isolation mode is discussed in
   Section `Running GMT in isolation mode`_.

In addition to those parameters that directly affect the plot there are
numerous parameters than modify units, scales, etc. For a complete
listing, see the :doc:`gmt.conf` man pages.
We suggest that you go through all the available parameters at least
once so that you know what is available to change via one of the
described mechanisms.  The gmt.conf file can be cleared by running
**gmt clear conf**.

Command line arguments
----------------------

Each program requires certain arguments specific to its operation. These
are explained in the manual pages and in the usage messages.
We have tried to choose letters of the alphabet which
stand for the argument so that they will be easy to remember. Each
argument specification begins with a hyphen (except input file names;
see below), followed by a letter, and sometimes a number or character
string immediately after the letter. *Do not* space between the hyphen,
letter, and number or string. *Do* space between options. Example:

   ::

    gmt coast -R0/20/0/20 -Ggray -JM6i -Wthin -Baf -V -P > map.ps

Standardized command line options
---------------------------------

Most of the programs take many of the same arguments such as those related
to setting the data region, the map projection, etc. The 23 switches in
Table :ref:`switches <tbl-switches>` have the same meaning in all the programs (although
some programs may not use all of them). These options will be described
here as well as in the manual pages, as is vital that you understand how
to use these options. We will present these options in order of
importance (some are used a lot more than others).

Data domain or map region: The **-R** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **-R** option defines the map region or data domain of interest. It
may be specified in one of five ways, two of which are shown in Figure
:ref:`Map region <gmt_region>`:

#. **-R**\ *xmin*/*xmax*/*ymin*/*ymax*. This is the standard way to
   specify Cartesian data domains and geographical regions when using
   map projections where meridians and parallels are rectilinear.

#. **-R**\ *xlleft*/*ylleft*/*xuright*/*yuright*\ **+r**. This form is
   used with map projections that are oblique, making meridians and
   parallels poor choices for map boundaries. Here, we instead specify
   the lower left corner and upper right corner geographic coordinates,
   followed by the modifier **+r**. This form guarantees a rectangular map
   even though lines of equal longitude and latitude are not straight lines.

#. **-R**\ *gridfile*. This will copy the domain settings found for the
   grid in specified file. Note that depending on the nature of the
   calling program, this mechanism will also set grid spacing and
   possibly the grid registration (see
   Section `Grid registration: The -r option`_).

#. **-R**\ *code1,code2,...*\ [**+r**\|\ **R**\ [*incs*]]. This indirectly supplies
   the region by consulting the DCW (Digital Chart of the World) database and derives
   the bounding regions for one or more countries given by the codes.
   Simply append one or more comma-separated countries using the two-character
   ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 convention (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
   To select a state within a country (if available), append .state, e.g, US.TX for Texas.
   To specify a whole continent, prepend = to any of the continent codes AF (Africa),
   AN (Antarctica), AS (Asia), EU (Europe), OC (Oceania), NA (North America), or SA
   (South America).  Append **+r** to modify exact bounding box coordinates obtained from
   the polygon(s): Append *inc*, *xinc*/*yinc*, or *winc*/*einc*/*sinc*/*ninc* to adjust the
   final region boundaries to be multiples of these steps [default is no adjustment].
   Alternatively, use **+R** to extend the region outward by adding these increments
   instead [default is no extension].  As an example, **-R**\ *FR*\ **+r**\ 1 will select
   the national bounding box of France rounded to nearest integer degree.

#. **-R**\ *code*\ *x0*/*y0*/*nx*/*ny*.  This method can be used when creating
   grids.  Here, *code* is a 2-character combination of **L**\ , **C**\ , **R** (for left, center,
   or right) and **T**\ , **M**\ , **B** for top, middle, or bottom. e.g., **BL** for lower left.  This
   indicates which point on a rectangular grid region the *x0*/*y0* coordinates
   refer to, and the grid dimensions *nx* and *ny* are used with grid spacings given
   via **-I** to create the corresponding region.

.. _gmt_region:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-R.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   The plot region can be specified in two different ways. (a) Extreme values
   for each dimension, or (b) coordinates of lower left and upper right corners.

For rectilinear projections the first two forms give identical results.
Depending on the selected map projection (or the kind of expected input
data), the boundary coordinates may take on several different formats:

Geographic coordinates:
    These are longitudes and latitudes and may be given in decimal
    degrees (e.g., -123.45417) or in the
    [±]\ *ddd*\ [:*mm*\ [:*ss*\ [*.xxx*]]][\ **W**\ \|\ **E**\ \|\ **S**\ \|\ **N**]
    format (e.g., 123:27:15W). Note that **-Rg** and **-Rd** are
    shorthands for "global domain" **-R**\ *0*/*360*/*-90*/*90* and
    **-R**\ *-180*/*180*/*-90*/*90*, respectively.

    When used in conjunction with the Cartesian Linear Transformation
    (**-Jx** or **-JX**) —which can be used to map floating point data,
    geographical coordinates, as well as time coordinates— it is prudent
    to indicate that you are using geographical coordinates in one of
    the following ways:

    -  Use **-Rg** or **-Rd** to indicate the global domain.

    -  Use **-Rg**\ *xmin*/*xmax*/*ymin*/*ymax* to indicate a limited
       geographic domain.

    -  Add **W**, **E**, **S**, or **N** to the coordinate limits or add
       the generic **D** or **G**. Example:
       **-R**\ *0*/*360G*/*-90*/*90N*.

    Alternatively, you may indicate geographical coordinates by
    supplying **-fg**; see Section `Data type selection: The -f option`_.

Projected coordinates:
    These are Cartesian projected coordinates compatible with the chosen
    projection and are given in a length *unit* set via the **+u** modifier, (e.g.,
    -200/200/-300/300\ **+uk** for a 400 by 600 km rectangular area centered
    on the projection center (0, 0). These coordinates are internally
    converted to the corresponding geographic (longitude, latitude)
    coordinates for the lower left and upper right corners. This form is
    convenient when you want to specify a region directly in the
    projected units (e.g., UTM meters). For allowable units, see
    Table :ref:`distunits <tbl-distunits>`.

Calendar time coordinates:
    These are absolute time coordinates referring to a Gregorian or ISO
    calendar. The general format is [*date*]\ **T**\ [*clock*],
    where *date* must be in the *yyyy*\ [*-mm*\ [*-dd*]] (year, month,
    day-of-month) or *yyyy*\ [*-jjj*] (year and day-of-year) for
    Gregorian calendars and *yyyy*\ [*-*\ **W**\ *ww*\ [*-d*]] (year,
    week, and day-of-week) for the ISO calendar. If no *date* is given
    we assume the current day. The **T** flag is required if a *clock* is given.

    The optional *clock* string is a 24-hour clock in
    *hh*\ [*:mm*\ [*:ss*\ [*.xxx*]]] format. If no *clock* is given it
    implies 00:00:00, i.e., the start of the specified day. Note that
    not all of the specified entities need be present in the data. All
    calendar date-clock strings are internally represented as double
    precision seconds since proleptic Gregorian date Monday January 1
    00:00:00 0001. Proleptic means we assume that the modern calendar
    can be extrapolated forward and backward; a year zero is used, and
    Gregory's reforms [11]_ are extrapolated backward. Note that this is
    not historical.

Relative time coordinates:
    These are coordinates which count seconds, hours, days or years
    relative to a given epoch. A combination of the parameters
    :ref:`TIME_EPOCH <TIME_EPOCH>` and :ref:`TIME_UNIT <TIME_UNIT>` define the epoch and time unit.
    The parameter :ref:`TIME_SYSTEM <TIME_SYSTEM>` provides a few shorthands for common
    combinations of epoch and unit, like **j2000** for days since noon
    of 1 Jan 2000. The default relative time coordinate is that of UNIX
    computers: seconds since 1 Jan 1970. Denote relative time
    coordinates by appending the optional lower case **t** after the
    value. When it is otherwise apparent that the coordinate is relative
    time (for example by using the **-f** switch), the **t** can be omitted.

Radians:
    For angular regions (and increments) specified in radians you may use a set of
    forms indicating multiples or fractions of :math:`\pi`.  Valid forms are
    [±][\ *s*\ ]pi[*f*\ ], where *s* and *f* are any integer or floating point numbers,
    e.g., -2pi/2pi3 goes from -360 to 120 degrees (but in radians).  When GMT parses one
    of these forms we alert the labeling machinery to look for certain combinations of pi,
    limited to *n*\ pi, 1.5pi, and fractions 3/4, 2/3, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 pi.  When an
    annotated value is within roundoff-error of these combinations we typeset the label
    using the Greek letter for pi and required multiples or fractions.

Other coordinates:
    These are simply any coordinates that are not related to geographic
    or calendar time or relative time and are expected to be simple
    floating point values such as
    [±]\ *xxx.xxx*\ [**E**\ \|\ **e**\ \|\ **D**\ \|\ **d**\ [±]\ *xx*\ ],
    i.e., regular or exponential notations, with the enhancement to understand
    FORTRAN double precision output which may use **D** instead of **E** for
    exponents. These values are simply converted as they are to internal
    representation. [12]_

Coordinate transformations and map projections: The **-J** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option selects the coordinate transformation or map projection. The
general format is

-  **-J**\ :math:`\delta`\ [*parameters*/]\ *scale*. Here, :math:`\delta`
   is a *lower-case* letter of the alphabet that selects a particular
   map projection, the *parameters* is zero or more slash-delimited
   projection parameter, and *scale* is map scale given in distance
   units per degree or as 1:xxxxx.

-  **-J**\ :math:`\Delta`\ [*parameters*/]\ *width*. Here, :math:`\Delta`
   is an *upper-case* letter of the alphabet that selects a particular
   map projection, the *parameters* is zero or more slash-delimited
   projection parameter, and *width* is map width (map height is
   automatically computed from the implied map scale and region).

Since GMT version 4.3.0, there is an alternative way to specify the
projections: use the same abbreviation as in the mapping package
**Proj4**. The options thus either look like:

-  **-J**\ *abbrev*/[*parameters*/]\ *scale*. Here, *abbrev* is a
   *lower-case* abbreviation that selects a particular map projection,
   the *parameters* is zero or more slash-delimited projection
   parameter, and *scale* is map scale given in distance units per
   degree or as 1:xxxxx.

-  **-J**\ *Abbrev*/[*parameters*/]\ *width*. Here, *Abbrev* is an
   *capitalized* abbreviation that selects a particular map projection,
   the *parameters* is zero or more slash-delimited projection
   parameter, and *width* is map width (map height is automatically
   computed from the implied map scale and region).

The projections available in GMT are presented in Figure
:ref:`gmt_projections`. For details on all GMT projections and the required
parameters, see the :doc:`basemap` man page. We will also show examples of
every projection in the next Chapters, and a quick summary of projection
syntax was given in Chapter `GMT Overview and Quick Reference`_.

Map frame and axes annotations: The **-B** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is potentially the most complicated option in GMT,
but most examples of its usage are actually quite simple. We distinguish
between to sets of information: Frame settings and Axes parameters.  These
are set separately by their own **-B** invocations; hence multiple **-B**
specifications may be specified. The frame settings covers things such
as which axes should be plotted, canvas fill, plot title, and what type
of gridlines be drawn, whereas the Axes settings deal with annotation,
tick, and gridline intervals, axes labels, and annotation units.

The Frame settings are specified by

-  **-B**\ [*axes*][**+b**][**+g**\ *fill*][**+n**][**+o**\ *lon/lat*][**+t**\ *title*]

Here, the optional *axes* dictates which of the axes should be drawn
and possibly annotated.  By default, all 4 map boundaries (or plot axes)
are plotted (denoted **W**, **E**, **S**, **N**). To change this selection,
append the codes for those you want (e.g., **WSn**). In this example,
the lower case **n** denotes to draw the axis and (major and minor) tick
marks on the "northern" (top) edge of the plot. The upper case **WS** will
annotate the "western" and "southern" axes with numerals and plot the
any axis labels in addition to draw axis/tick-marks.  For 3-D plots you can
also specify **Z** or **z**.  By default a single vertical axes will then be
plotted at the most suitable map corner.  You can override this by appending
any combination of corner ids **1234**, where **1** represents the lower left
corner and the order goes counter-clockwise.  Append **+b** to draw the outline
of the 3-D box defined by **-R**; this modifier is also needed to display
gridlines in the x--z, y--z planes.  You may paint the
map canvas by appending the **+g**\ *fill* modifier [Default is no fill].
If gridlines are specified via the Axes parameters (discussed below) then
by default these are referenced to the North pole.  If, however, you wish
to produce oblique gridlines about another pole you can append **+o**\ *lon/lat*
to change this behavior (the modifier is ignored if no gridlines are requested).
Append **+n** to have no frame and annotations at all [Default is controlled by the codes].
Finally, you may optionally add **+t**\ *title* to place a title that
will appear centered above the plot frame.

The Axes settings are specified by

-  **-B**\ [**p**\|\ **s**][**x**\|\ **y**\|\ **z**]\ *intervals*\ [**+a**\ *angle*\ \|\ **n**\ \|\ **p**\ ][\ **+l**\ *label*][**+p**\ *prefix*][**+u**\ *unit*]

but you may also split this into two separate invocations for clarity, i.e.,

-   **-B**\ [**p**\|\ **s**][**x**\|\ **y**\|\ **z**][**+a**\ *angle*\ \|\ **n**\ \|\ **p**\ ][**+l**\ \|\ **L**\ *label*][**+p**\ *prefix*][**+s**\ \|\ **S**\ *seclabel*][**+u**\ *unit*]
-   **-B**\ [**p**\|\ **s**][**x**\|\ **y**\|\ **z**]\ *intervals*

    The first optional flag following **-B** selects **p** (rimary) [Default] or
    **s** (econdary) axes information (mostly used for time axes annotations).
    The [**x**\|\ **y**\|\ **z**] flags specify which axes you are providing information for.
    If none are given then we default to **xy**.  If you wish to give different annotation intervals
    or labels for the various axes then you must repeat the **B** option for
    each axis (If a 3-D basemap is selected with **-p** and **-Jz**, use **-Bz**
    to give settings for the vertical axis.).  To add a label to an axis,
    just append **+l**\ *label* (Cartesian projections only). Use **+L** to
    force a horizontal label for *y*-axes (useful for very short labels).
    For Cartesian axes you may specify an alternate via **+s** which is used for
    right or upper axis axis label (with any **+l** label used for left and bottom axes).
    If the axis annotation should have a leading text prefix (e.g., dollar sign for those
    plots of your net worth) you can append **+p**\ *prefix*. For geographic maps
    the addition of degree symbols, etc. is automatic (and controlled by the GMT
    default setting :ref:`FORMAT_GEO_MAP <FORMAT_GEO_MAP>`). However, for other plots you can add
    specific units by adding **+u**\ *unit*.  If any of these text strings contain
    spaces or special characters you will need to enclose them in quotes.
    Cartesian x-axes also allow for the optional **+a**\ *angle*, which
    will plot slanted annotations; *angle* is measured with respect to the horizontal
    and must be in the -90 <= *angle* <= 90 range only.  Also, **+an** is a shorthand
    for normal (i.e., **+a**\ 90) and **+ap** for parallel (i.e., **+a**\ 0) annotations
    [Default].  For the y-axis, arbitrary angles are not allowed but **+an** and **+ap**
    specify annotations normal [Default] and parallel to the axis, respectively.  Note that
    these defaults can be changed via :ref:`MAP_ANNOT_ORTHO <MAP_ANNOT_ORTHO>`.

The *intervals* specification is a concatenated string made up of substrings of the form

[**t**]\ *stride*\ [*phase*][**u**].

The **t** flag sets the axis
item of interest; the available items are listed in Table :ref:`inttype <tbl-inttype>`.
Normally, equidistant annotations occur at multiples of *stride*; you
can phase-shift this by appending *phase*, which can be a positive or
negative number.

.. _tbl-inttype:

+------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Flag**   | **Description**                     |
+============+=====================================+
| **a**      | Annotation and major tick spacing   |
+------------+-------------------------------------+
| **f**      | Minor tick spacing                  |
+------------+-------------------------------------+
| **g**      | Grid line spacing                   |
+------------+-------------------------------------+

Note that the appearance of certain time annotations (month-, week-, and
day-names) may be affected by the :ref:`GMT_LANGUAGE <GMT_LANGUAGE>`,
:ref:`FORMAT_TIME_PRIMARY_MAP <FORMAT_TIME_PRIMARY_MAP>`, and
:ref:`FORMAT_TIME_SECONDARY_MAP <FORMAT_TIME_SECONDARY_MAP>` settings.

For automated plots the region may not always be the same and thus it
can be difficult to determine the appropriate *stride* in advance. Here
GMT provides the opportunity to auto-select the spacing between the
major and minor ticks and the grid lines, by not specifying the *stride*
value. For example, **-Bafg** will select all three spacings
automatically for both axes. In case of longitude--latitude plots, this
will keep the spacing the same on both axes. You can also use
**-Bafg/afg** to auto-select them separately. Also note that given the
myriad ways of specifying time-axis annotations, the automatic selections
may have to be overridden with manual settings to active exactly what you need.

In the case of automatic spacing, when the *stride* argument is omitted
after **g**, the grid line spacing is chosen the same as the minor tick
spacing; unless **g** is used in consort with **a**, then the grid lines
are spaced the same as the annotations.

The unit flag **u** can take on one of 18 codes; these are listed in
Table :ref:`units <tbl-units>`. Almost all of these units are time-axis specific.
However, the **m** and **s** units will be interpreted as arc minutes
and arc seconds, respectively, when a map projection is in effect.

As mentioned, there may be two levels of annotations. Here, "primary" refers to the
annotation that is closest to the axis (this is the primary annotation),
while "secondary" refers to the secondary annotation that is plotted
further from the axis. The examples below will clarify what is meant.
Note that the terms "primary" and "secondary" do not reflect any
hierarchical order of units: The "primary" annotation interval is
usually smaller (e.g., days) while the "secondary" annotation interval
typically is larger (e.g., months).

Geographic basemaps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Geographic basemaps may differ from regular plot axis in that some
projections support a "fancy" form of axis and is selected by the
:ref:`MAP_FRAME_TYPE <MAP_FRAME_TYPE>` setting. The annotations will be formatted
according to the :ref:`FORMAT_GEO_MAP <FORMAT_GEO_MAP>` template and
:ref:`MAP_DEGREE_SYMBOL <MAP_DEGREE_SYMBOL>` setting. A simple example of part of a basemap
is shown in Figure :ref:`Geographic map border <basemap_border>`.

.. _basemap_border:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_geo_1.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Geographic map border using separate selections for annotation,
   frame, and grid intervals.  Formatting of the annotation is controlled by
   the parameter :ref:`FORMAT_GEO_MAP <FORMAT_GEO_MAP>` in your :doc:`gmt.conf`.

The machinery for primary and secondary annotations introduced for
time-series axes can also be utilized for geographic basemaps. This may
be used to separate degree annotations from minutes- and
seconds-annotations. For a more complicated basemap example using
several sets of intervals, including different intervals and pen
attributes for grid lines and grid crosses, see Figure :ref:`Complex basemap
<complex_basemap>`.

.. _complex_basemap:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_geo_2.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Geographic map border with both primary (P) and secondary (S) components.

Cartesian linear axes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For non-geographic axes, the :ref:`MAP_FRAME_TYPE <MAP_FRAME_TYPE>` setting is implicitly
set to plain. Other than that, cartesian linear axes are very similar to
geographic axes. The annotation format may be controlled with the
:ref:`FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT <FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT>` parameter. By default, it is set to "%g", which
is a C language format statement for floating point numbers [13]_, and
with this setting the various axis routines will automatically determine
how many decimal points should be used by inspecting the *stride*
settings. If :ref:`FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT <FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT>` is set to another format it will be
used directly (.e.g, "%.2f" for a fixed, two decimals format). Note that
for these axes you may use the *unit* setting to add a unit string to
each annotation (see Figure :ref:`Axis label <axis_label_basemap>`).

.. _axis_label_basemap:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_linear.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Linear Cartesian projection axis.  Long tick-marks accompany
   annotations, shorter ticks indicate frame interval. The axis label is
   optional. For this example we used ``-R0/12/0/0.95 -JX3i/0.3i -Ba4f2g1+lFrequency+u" %" -BS``

There are occasions when the length of the annotations are such that placing them
horizontally (which is the default) may lead to overprinting or too few annotations.
One solution is to request slanted annotations for the x-axis (e.g., Figure :ref:`Axis label <axis_slanted_basemap>`)
via the **+a**\ *angle* modifier.


.. _axis_slanted_basemap:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_slanted.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Linear Cartesian projection axis with slanted annotations.
   For this example we used ``-R2000/2020/35/45 -JX12c -Bxa2f+a-30 -BS``.
   For the y-axis only the modifier **+ap** for parallel is allowed.


Cartesian log\ :sub:`10` axes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the logarithmic nature of annotation spacings, the *stride*
parameter takes on specific meanings. The following concerns are
specific to log axes (see Figure :ref:`Logarithmic projection axis
<Log_projection>`):

*  *stride* must be 1, 2, 3, or a negative integer -n.
   Annotations/ticks will then occur at 1, 1-2-5, or 1,2,3,4,...,9,
   respectively, for each magnitude range. For *-n* the
   annotations will take place every *n*\ 'th magnitude.

*  Append **l** to *stride*. Then, log\ :sub:`10` of the annotation
   is plotted at every integer log\ :sub:`10` value (e.g.,
   *x = 100* will be annotated as "2") [Default annotates *x* as is].

*  Append **p** to *stride*. Then, annotations appear as 10 raised to
   log\ :sub:`10` of the value (e.g., 10\ :sup:`-5`).

.. _Log_projection:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_log.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Logarithmic projection axis using separate values for annotation,
   frame, and grid intervals.  (top) Here, we have chosen to annotate the actual
   values.  Interval = 1 means every whole power of 10, 2 means 1, 2, 5 times
   powers of 10, and 3 means every 0.1 times powers of 10.  We used
   -R1/1000/0/1 -JX3il/0.25i -Ba1f2g3. (middle) Here, we have chosen to
   annotate :math:`\log_{10}` of the actual values, with -Ba1f2g3l.
   (bottom) We annotate every power of 10 using :math:`\log_{10}` of the actual
   values as exponents, with -Ba1f2g3p.

Cartesian exponential axes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Normally, *stride* will be used to create equidistant (in the user's
unit) annotations or ticks, but because of the exponential nature of the
axis, such annotations may converge on each other at one end of the
axis. To avoid this problem, you can append **p** to *stride*, and the
annotation interval is expected to be in transformed units, yet the
annotation itself will be plotted as un-transformed units (see Figure
:ref:`Power projection axis <Pow_projection>`). E.g., if
*stride* = 1 and power = 0.5 (i.e., sqrt), then equidistant annotations
labeled 1, 4, 9, ... will appear.

.. _Pow_projection:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_pow.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Exponential or power projection axis. (top) Using an exponent of 0.5
   yields a :math:`sqrt(x)` axis.  Here, intervals refer to actual data values,
   in -R0/100/0/0.9 -JX3ip0.5/0.25i -Ba20f10g5.
   (bottom) Here, intervals refer to projected values, although the annotation
   uses the corresponding unprojected values, as in -Ba3f2g1p.

.. _cartesian_time_axes:

Cartesian time axes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What sets time axis apart from the other kinds of plot axes is the
numerous ways in which we may want to tick and annotate the axis. Not
only do we have both primary and secondary annotation items but we also
have interval annotations versus tick-mark annotations, numerous time
units, and several ways in which to modify the plot. We will demonstrate
this flexibility with a series of examples. While all our examples will
only show a single *x*\ -axis (south, selected via **-BS**), time-axis
annotations are supported for all axes.

Our first example shows a time period of almost two months in Spring
2000. We want to annotate the month intervals as well as the date at the start of each week:

   ::

     gmt set FORMAT_DATE_MAP=-o FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY +9p
     gmt basemap -R2000-4-1T/2000-5-25T/0/1 -JX5i/0.2i -Bpa7Rf1d -Bsa1O -BS -P > GMT_-B_time1.ps

These commands result in Figure :ref:`Cartesian time axis <cartesian_axis1>`.
Note the leading hyphen in the :ref:`FORMAT_DATE_MAP <FORMAT_DATE_MAP>`
removes leading zeros from calendar items (e.g., 02 becomes 2).

.. _cartesian_axis1:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time1.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 1

The next example shows two different ways to annotate an axis portraying 2 days in July 1969:

   ::

     gmt set FORMAT_DATE_MAP "o dd" FORMAT_CLOCK_MAP hh:mm FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY +9p
     gmt basemap -R1969-7-21T/1969-7-23T/0/1 -JX5i/0.2i -Bpa6Hf1h -Bsa1K -BS -P -K > GMT_-B_time2.ps
     gmt basemap -R -J -Bpa6Hf1h -Bsa1D -BS -O -Y0.65i >> GMT_-B_time2.ps

The lower example (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis2`) chooses to annotate the weekdays (by
specifying **a**\ 1\ **K**) while the upper example choses dates (by
specifying **a**\ 1\ **D**). Note how the clock format only selects
hours and minutes (no seconds) and the date format selects a month name,
followed by one space and a two-digit day-of-month number.

.. _cartesian_axis2:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time2.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 2

The third example (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis3`) presents two years, annotating
both the years and every 3rd month.

   ::

     gmt set FORMAT_DATE_MAP o FORMAT_TIME_PRIMARY_MAP Character FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY +9p
     gmt basemap -R1997T/1999T/0/1 -JX5i/0.2i -Bpa3Of1o -Bsa1Y -BS -P > GMT_-B_time3.ps

Note that while the year annotation is centered on the 1-year interval,
the month annotations must be centered on the corresponding month and
*not* the 3-month interval. The :ref:`FORMAT_DATE_MAP <FORMAT_DATE_MAP>` selects month name
only and :ref:`FORMAT_TIME_PRIMARY_MAP <FORMAT_TIME_PRIMARY_MAP>` selects the 1-character, upper
case abbreviation of month names using the current language (selected by
:ref:`GMT_LANGUAGE <GMT_LANGUAGE>`).

.. _cartesian_axis3:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time3.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 3

The fourth example (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis4`) only shows a few hours of a day, using
relative time by specifying **t** in the **-R** option while the
:ref:`TIME_UNIT <TIME_UNIT>` is **d** (for days). We select both primary and secondary
annotations, ask for a 12-hour clock, and let time go from right to left:

   ::

     gmt set FORMAT_CLOCK_MAP=-hham FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY +9p TIME_UNIT d
     gmt basemap -R0.2t/0.35t/0/1 -JX-5i/0.2i -Bpa15mf5m -Bsa1H -BS -P > GMT_-B_time4.ps

.. _cartesian_axis4:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time4.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 4

The fifth example shows a few weeks of time (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis5`). The lower axis
shows ISO weeks with week numbers and abbreviated names of the weekdays.
The upper uses Gregorian weeks (which start at the day chosen by
:ref:`TIME_WEEK_START <TIME_WEEK_START>`); they do not have numbers.

   ::

    gmt set FORMAT_DATE_MAP u FORMAT_TIME_PRIMARY_MAP Character \
           FORMAT_TIME_SECONDARY_MAP full FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY +9p
    gmt basemap -R1969-7-21T/1969-8-9T/0/1 -JX5i/0.2i -Bpa1K -Bsa1U -BS -P -K > GMT_-B_time5.ps

    gmt basemap -R -J -Bpa3Kf1k -Bsa1r -BS -O -Y0.65i >> GMT_-B_time5.ps

.. _cartesian_axis5:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time5.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 5

Our sixth example (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis6`) shows the first five months of
1996, and we have annotated each month with an abbreviated, upper case name and
2-digit year. Only the primary axes information is specified.

   ::

    gmt set FORMAT_DATE_MAP "o yy" FORMAT_TIME_PRIMARY_MAP Abbreviated
    gmt basemap -R1996T/1996-6T/0/1 -JX5i/0.2i -Ba1Of1d -BS -P > GMT_-B_time6.ps

.. _cartesian_axis6:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-B_time6.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cartesian time axis, example 6

Our seventh and final example (Figure :ref:`cartesian_axis7`) illustrates
annotation of year-days. Unless we specify the formatting with a leading hyphen
in :ref:`FORMAT_DATE_MAP <FORMAT_DATE_MAP>` we get 3-digit integer days. Note that
in order to have the two years annotated we need to allow for the annotation of
small fractional intervals; normally such truncated interval must be at
least half of a full interval.

   ::

    gmt set FORMAT_DATE_MAP jjj TIME_INTERVAL_FRACTION 0.05 FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY +9p
    gmt basemap -R2000-12-15T/2001-1-15T/0/1 -JX5i/0.2i -Bpa5Df1d -Bsa1Y -BS -P > GMT_-B_time7.ps

   Cartesian time axis, example 7

.. _custom_axes:

Custom axes
^^^^^^^^^^^

Irregularly spaced annotations or annotations based on
look-up tables can be implemented using the *custom* annotation
mechanism. Here, we given the **c** (custom) type to the **-B** option
followed by a filename that contains the annotations (and
tick/grid-lines specifications) for one axis. The file can contain any
number of comments (lines starting with #) and any number of records of
the format

| *coord* *type* [*label*]

The *coord* is the location of the desired annotation, tick, or
grid-line, whereas *type* is a string composed of letters from **a**
(annotation), **i** interval annotation, **f** frame tick, and **g**
gridline. You must use either **a** or **i** within one file; no mixing
is allowed. The coordinates should be arranged in increasing order. If
*label* is given it replaces the normal annotation based on the *coord*
value. Our last example (Figure :ref:`Custom and irregular annotations
<Custom_annotations>`) shows such a custom basemap with an interval
annotations on the *x*-axis and irregular annotations on the *y*-axis.

   Custom and irregular annotations, tick-marks, and gridlines.


Timestamps on plots: The **-U** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **-U** option draws UNIX System time stamp. Optionally, append an
arbitrary text string (surrounded by double quotes), or the code **c**,
which will plot the current command string (Figure
:ref:`Time stamp <U_option>`).

.. _U_option:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-U.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   The -U option makes it easy to date a plot.


Verbose feedback: The **-V** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **-V** option selects verbose mode, which will send
progress reports to standard error. Even more verbose levels are **-Vl**
(long verbose) and **-Vd** (debug). Normal verbosity level produces only
error and warning messages. This is the default or can be selected by
using **-Vn**. If compiled with backward-compatibility support, the
default is **-Vc**, which includes warnings about deprecated usage.
Finally, **-Vq** can be used to run without any warnings or errors. This
option can also be set by specifying the default :ref:`GMT_VERBOSE <GMT_VERBOSE>`, as
**quiet**, **normal**, **compat**, **verbose**, **long_verbose**, or
**debug**, in order of increased verbosity.

Plot positioning and layout: The **-X** **-Y** options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **-X** and **-Y** options shift origin of plot by (*xoff*,\ *yoff*)
inches (Default is (:ref:`MAP_ORIGIN_X <MAP_ORIGIN_X>`, :ref:`MAP_ORIGIN_Y <MAP_ORIGIN_Y>`) for new
plots [15]_ and (0,0) for overlays (**-O**)). By default, all
translations are relative to the previous origin (see Figure
:ref:`Plot positioning <XY_options>`). Supply
offset as **c** to center the plot in that direction relative to the
page margin. Absolute translations (i.e., relative to a fixed point
(0,0) at the lower left corner of the paper) can be achieve by
prepending "a" to the offsets. Subsequent overlays will be co-registered
with the previous plot unless the origin is shifted using these options.
The offsets are measured in the current coordinates system (which can be
rotated using the initial **-P** option; subsequent **-P** options for
overlays are ignored).

.. _XY_options:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_-XY.*

   :align: center

   Plot origin can be translated freely with -X -Y.

OGR/GMT GIS i/o: The **-a** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT relies on external tools to translate geospatial files such as
shapefiles into a format we can read. The tool **ogr2ogr** in the GDAL
package can do such translations and preserve the aspatial metadata via
a new OGR/GMT format specification (See Chapter `The GMT Vector Data Format for OGR Compatibility`_).
For this to be useful we need a mechanism to associate certain metadata values with
required input and output columns expected by GMT programs. The **-a**
option allows you to supply one or more comma-separated associations
*col=name*, where *name* is the name of an aspatial attribute field in a
OGR/GMT file and whose value we wish to as data input for column *col*.
The given aspatial field thus replaces any other value already set. Note
that *col = 0* is the first data columns. Note that if no aspatial
attributes are needed then the **-a** option is not needed -- GMT will
still process and read such data files.

OGR/GMT input with **-a** option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to populate GMT data columns with (constant) values
specified by aspatial attributes, use **-a** and append any number of
comma-separated *col=name* associations. E.g., *2=depth* will read the
spatial *x,y* columns from the file and add a third (*z*) column based
on the value of the aspatial field called *depth*. You can also
associate aspatial fields with other settings such as labels, fill
colors, pens, and values used to look-up colors. Do so by letting the
*col* value be one of **D**, **G**, **L**, **T**, **W**, or **Z**. This
works analogously to how standard multi-segment files can pass such
options via its segment headers (See Chapter `GMT file formats`_).

OGR/GMT output with **-a** option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also make GMT table-writing tools output the OGR/GMT format
directly. Again, specify if certain GMT data columns with constant
values should be stored as aspatial metadata using the
*col=name*\ [:*type*], where you can optionally specify what data type
it should be (double, integer, string, logical, byte, or datetime)
[double is default]. As for input, you can also use the special *col*
entries of **D**, **G**, **L**, **T**, **W**, or **Z** to have values
stored as options in segment headers be used as the source for the name
aspatial field. Finally, for output you must append
+\ **g**\ *geometry*, where *geometry* can be any of
[**M**]\ **POINT**\ \|\ **LINE**\ \|\ **POLY**; the
**M** represent the multi-versions of these three geometries. Use
upper-case +\ **G** to signal that you want to split any line or polygon
features that straddle the Dateline.

Binary table i/o: The **-b** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All GMT programs that accept table data as *primary* input may read ASCII, native
binary, shapefiles, or netCDF tables (Any *secondary* input files provided via command line
options are always expected to be in ASCII format). Native binary files may have a header section
and the **-h**\ *n* option (see Section `Header data records: The -h option`_) can be used to
skip the first *n* bytes. The data record can be in any format, you may mix
different data types and even byte-swap individual columns or the entire record. When using
native binary data the user must be aware of the fact that GMT has no
way of determining the actual number of columns in the file. You must
therefore pass that information to GMT via the binary
**-bi** *n*\ **t** option, where *n* is the number of data
columns of given type **t**, where **t** must be one of **c** (signed 1-byte character,
int8_t), **u** (unsigned 1-byte character, uint8_t), **h** (signed
2-byte int, int16_t), **H** (unsigned 2-byte int, uint16_t), **i**
(signed 4-byte int, int32_t), **I** (unsigned 4-byte int, uint32_t),
**l** (signed 8-byte int, int64_t), **L** (unsigned 8-byte int,
uint64_t), **f** (4-byte single-precision float), and **d** (8-byte
double-precision float). In addition, use **x** to skip *n* bytes
anywhere in the record. For a mixed-type data record you can concatenate
several [*n*]\ **t** combinations, separated by commas. You may append
**w** to any of the items to force byte-swapping. Alternatively, append
**+L**\ \|\ **B** to indicate that the entire data file should be
read or written as little- or big-endian, respectively. Here, *n* is the
number of each item in your binary file. Note that *n* may be larger
than *m*, the number of columns that the GMT program requires to do
its task. If *n* is not given then it defaults to *m* and all columns
are assumed to be of the single specified type **t** [**d** (double), if
not set]. If *n* < *m* an error is generated. Multiple segment
files are allowed and the segment headers are assumed to be records
where all the fields equal NaN.

For native binary output, use the **-bo** option; see **-bi** for further details.

Because of its meta data, reading netCDF tables (i.e., netCDF files
containing 1-dimensional arrays) is quite a bit less complex than
reading native binary files. When feeding netCDF tables to programs like
:doc:`plot`, the program will automatically
recognize the format and read whatever amount of columns are needed for
that program. To steer which columns are to be read, the user can append
the suffix **?**\ *var1*\ **/**\ *var2*\ **/**\ *...* to the netCDF file
name, where *var1*, *var2*, etc. are the names of the variables to be
processed. No **-bi** option is needed in this case.

Currently, netCDF tables can only be input, not output. For more
information, see Chapter `GMT file formats`_.

Missing data conversion: The **-d** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within GMT, any missing values are represented by the IEEE NaN value.
However, there are occasionally the need to handle user data where
missing data are represented by some unlikely data value such as -99999.
Since GMT cannot guess that in your data set -99999 is a special value,
you can use the **-d** option to have such values replaced with NaNs.
Similarly, should your GMT output need to conform to such a requirement
you can replace all NaNs with the chosen nodata value.  If only input
or output should be affected, use **-di** or **-do**, respectably.

Data record pattern matching: The **-e** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modules that read ASCII tables will normally process all the data records
that are read.  The **-e** option offers a built-in pattern scanner that
will only pass records that match the given patterns or regular expressions.
The test can also be inverted to only pass data records that *do not* match
the pattern.  The test is *not* applied to header or segment headers.

Data type selection: The **-f** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When map projections are not required we must explicitly state what kind
of data each input or output column contains. This is accomplished with
the **-f** option. Following an optional **i** (for input only) or **o**
(for output only), we append a text string with information about each
column (or range of columns) separated by commas. Each string starts
with the column number (0 is first column) followed by either **x**
(longitude), **y** (latitude), **T** (absolute calendar time) or **t**
(relative time). If several consecutive columns have the same format you
may specify a range of columns rather than a single column, i.e., 0--4
for the first 5 columns. For example, if our input file has geographic
coordinates (latitude, longitude) with absolute calendar coordinates in
the columns 3 and 4, we would specify
**fi**\ 0\ **y**,1\ **x**,3--4\ **T**. All other columns are assumed to
have the default, floating point format and need not be set
individually. The shorthand **-f**\ [**i**\ \|\ **o**]\ **g**
means **-f**\ [**i**\ \|\ **o**]0x,1y (i.e., geographic
coordinates). A special use of **-f** is to select **-fp**\ [*unit*],
which *requires* **-J** and lets you use *projected* map coordinates
(e.g., UTM meters) as data input. Such coordinates are automatically
inverted to longitude, latitude during the data import. Optionally,
append a length *unit* (see Table :ref:`distunits <tbl-distunits>`) [meter]. For more
information, see Sections `Input data formats`_ and `Output data formats`_.

Data gap detection: The **-g** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT has several mechanisms that can determine line
segmentation. Typically, data segments are separated by multiple segment
header records (see Chapter `GMT file formats`_). However, if key data columns contain a
NaN we may also use that information to break lines into multiple
segments. This behavior is modified by the parameter
**IO_NAN_RECORDS** which by default is set to *skip*, meaning such
records are considered bad and simply skipped. If you wish such records
to indicate a segment boundary then set this parameter to *pass*.
Finally, you may wish to indicate gaps based on the data values
themselves. The **-g** option is used to detect gaps based on one or
more criteria (use **-g+** if *all* the criteria must be met; otherwise
only one of the specified criteria needs to be met to signify a data
gap). Gaps can be based on excessive jumps in the *x*- or
*y*-coordinates (**-gx** or **-gy**), or on the distance between points
(**-gd**). Append the *gap* distance and optionally a unit for actual
distances. For geographic data the optional unit may be arc
**d**\ egree, **m**\ inute, and **s**\ econd, or m\ **e**\ ter
[Default], **f**\ eet, **k**\ ilometer, **M**\ iles, or **n**\ autical
miles. For programs that map data to map coordinates you can optionally
specify these criteria to apply to the projected coordinates (by using
upper-case **-gX**, **-gY** or **-gD**). In that case, choose from
**c**\ entimeter, **i**\ nch or **p**\ oint [Default unit is controlled
by **PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT**]. Note: For **-gx** or **-gy** with time data
the unit is instead controlled by :ref:`TIME_UNIT <TIME_UNIT>`.

Header data records: The **-h** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **-h**\ [**i**\ \|\ **o**][*n_recs*] option
lets GMT know that input file(s) have *n_recs* header records [0]. If
there are more than one header record you must specify the number after
the **-h** option, e.g., **-h**\ 4. Note that blank lines and records
that start with the character # are automatically considered header
records and skipped. Thus, *n_recs* refers to general text lines that
do *not* start with # and thus must specifically be skipped in order for
the programs to function properly. The default number of such header
records if **-h** is used is one of the many parameters in the :doc:`gmt.conf` file
(**IO_N_HEADER_RECS**, by default 0), but can be overridden by
**-h**\ *n_header_recs*. Normally, programs that both read and write
tables will output the header records that are found on input. Use
**-hi** to suppress the writing of header records. You can use the
**-h** options modifiers to to tell programs to output extra header
records for titles, remarks or column names identifying each data column.

When **-b** is used to indicate binary data the **-h** takes on a
slightly different meaning. Now, the *n_recs* argument is taken to mean
how many *bytes* should be skipped (on input) or padded with the space
character (on output).

Input columns selection: The **-i** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **-i**\ *columns* option allows you to specify which
input file physical data columns to use and in what order. By default, GMT will
read all the data columns in the file, starting with the first column
(0). Using **-i** modifies that process and reads in a logical record based
on columns from the physical record. For instance, to use the 4th,
7th, and 3rd data column as the required *x,y,z* to
:doc:`blockmean` you would specify
**-i**\ 3,6,2 (since 0 is the first column). The chosen data columns
will be used as is. Optionally, you can specify that input columns
should be transformed according to a linear or logarithmic conversion.
Do so by appending [**+l**][\ **+s**\ *scale*][\ **+o**\ *offset*] to
each column (or range of columns). All items are optional: The **+l**
implies we should first take :math:`\log_{10}` of the data [leave as
is]. Next, we may scale the result by the given *scale* [1]. Finally, we
add in the specified *offset* [0].  If you want the trailing text to remain
part of your subset logical record then also select the special column
by requesting column **t**, otherwise we ignore trailing text.  Finally,
to use the entire numerical record and ignoring trailing text, use **-in**.

.. _gmt_record:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_record.png
   :width: 600 px
   :align: center

   The physical, logical (input) and output record in GMT.  Here, we are
   reading a file with 5 numerical columns plus some free-form text at the
   end.  Our module (here :doc:`plot`) will be used to plot circles at the
   given locations but we want to assign color based on the ``depth`` column
   (which we need to convert from meters to km) and symbol size based on the
   ``mag`` column (but we want to scale the magnitude by 0.01 to get suitable symbol sizes).
   We use **-i** to pull in the desired columns in the required order and apply
   the scaling, resulting in a logical input record with 4 columns.  The **-f** option
   can be used to specify column types in the logical record if it is not clear
   from the data themselves (such as when reading a binary file).  Finally, if
   a module needs to write out only a portion of the current logical record then
   you may use the corresponding **-o** option to select desired columns, including
   the trailing text column **t**.  Note that these column numbers now refer to
   the logical record, not the physical, since after reading the data there is no
   physical record, only the logical record in memory.

Grid interpolation parameters: The **-n** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **-n**\ *type* option controls parameters used for
2-D grids resampling. You can select the type of spline used (**-nb**
for B-spline smoothing, **-nc** for bicubic [Default], **-nl** for
bilinear, or **-nn** for nearest-node value). For programs that support
it, antialiasing is by default on; optionally, append **+a** to switch
off antialiasing. By default, boundary conditions are set according to
the grid type and extent. Change boundary conditions by appending
**+b**\ *BC*, where *BC* is either **g** for geographic boundary
conditions or one (or both) of **n** and **p** for natural or periodic
boundary conditions, respectively. Append **x** or **y** to only apply
the condition in one dimension. E.g., **-nb+nxpy** would imply natural
boundary conditions in the *x* direction and periodic conditions in the
*y* direction. Finally, append **+t**\ *threshold* to control how close
to nodes with NaN the interpolation should go. A *threshold* of 1.0
requires all (4 or 16) nodes involved in the interpolation to be
non-NaN. 0.5 will interpolate about half way from a non-NaN value; 0.1
will go about 90% of the way, etc.

Output columns selection: The **-o** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **-o**\ *columns* option allows you to specify which
columns to write on output and in what order. By default, GMT will
write all the data columns produced by the program. Using **-o**
modifies that process. For instance, to write just the 4th and 2nd data
column to the output you would use **-o**\ 3,1 (since 0 is the first column).
You can also use a column more than once, e.g., **-o**\ 3,1,3, to
duplicate a column on output.  Finally, if your logical record in memory
contains trailing text then you can include that by including the special
column **t** to your selections.  The text is always written after any
numerical columns.  Note that if you wanted to scale or shift the output
values you need to do so during reading, using the **-i** option.
To output all numerical columns and ignoring trailing text, use **-on**.

Perspective view: The **-p** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All plotting programs that normally produce a flat, two-dimensional
illustration can be told to view this flat illustration from a
particular vantage point, resulting in a perspective view. You can
select perspective view with the **-p** option by setting the azimuth
and elevation of the viewpoint [Default is 180/90]. When **-p** is used
in consort with **-Jz** or **-JZ**, a third value can be appended which
indicates at which *z*-level all 2-D material, like the plot frame, is
plotted (in perspective) [Default is at the bottom of the z-axis]. For
frames used for animation, you may want to append **+** to fix the
center of your data domain (or specify a particular world coordinate
point with **+w**\ *lon0/lat*\ [*z*\ ]) which will project to the center
of your page size (or you may specify the coordinates of the *projected*
view point with **+v**\ *x0/y0*. When **-p** is used without any further
arguments, the values from the last use of **-p** in a previous
GMT command will be used.  Alternatively, you can perform a simple rotation
about the z-axis by just giving the rotation angle.  Optionally, use **+v**
or **+w** to select another axis location than the plot origin.

.. _grid-registration:

Grid registration: The **-r** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All 2-D grids in GMT have their nodes
organized in one of two ways, known as *gridline*- and *pixel*-
registration. The GMT default is gridline registration; programs that
allow for the creation of grids can use the **-r** option (or **-rp**) to select
pixel registration instead.  Most observed data tend to be in gridline
registration while processed data sometime may be distributed in
pixel registration.  While you may convert between the two registrations
this conversion looses the Nyquist frequency and dampens the other
high frequencies.  It is best to avoid any registration conversion if you
can help it.  Planning ahead may be important.

Gridline registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this registration, the nodes are centered on the grid line
intersections and the data points represent the average value in a cell
of dimensions (:math:`x_{inc} \cdot y_{inc}`) centered on each node
(left side of Figure :ref:`Grid registration <Grid_registration>`).
In the case of grid line registration the number of nodes are related
to region and grid spacing by

.. math::

   \begin{array}{ccl}
   nx & =  &       (x_{max} - x_{min}) / x_{inc} + 1       \\
   ny & =  &       (y_{max} - y_{min}) / y_{inc} + 1
   \end{array}

which for the example in left side of Figure :ref:`Gridline registration
<Grid_registration>` yields nx = ny = 4.

Pixel registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, the nodes are centered in the grid cells, i.e., the areas
between grid lines, and the data points represent the average values
within each cell (right side of Figure :ref:`Grid registration
<Grid_registration>`). In the case of
pixel registration the number of nodes are related to region and grid
spacing by

.. _Grid_registration:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_registration.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Gridline- and pixel-registration of data nodes.  The red shade indicates the
   areas represented by the value at the node (solid circle).


.. math::

   \begin{array}{ccl}
   nx & =  &       (x_{max} - x_{min}) / x_{inc}   \\
   ny & =  &       (y_{max} - y_{min}) / y_{inc}
   \end{array}

Thus, given the same region (**-R**) and grid spacing, the
pixel-registered grids have one less column and one less row than the
gridline-registered grids; here we find nx = ny = 3.

NaN-record treatment: The **-s** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can use this option to suppress output for records whose *z*-value
equals NaN (by default we output all records). Alternatively, append
**+r** to reverse the suppression, i.e., only output the records whose
*z*-value equals NaN. Use **-s+a** to suppress output records where one
or more fields (and not necessarily *z*) equal NaN. Finally, you can
supply a comma-separated list of all columns or column ranges to
consider (before the optional modifiers) for this NaN test.

Layer PDF transparency: The **-t** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the PostScript language does not support transparency, PDF does,
and via PostScript extensions one can manipulate the transparency
levels of objects. The **-t** option allows you to change the
transparency level for the current overlay by appending a percentage in
the 0--100 range; the default is 0, or opaque. Transparency may also be
controlled on a feature by feature basis when setting color or fill (see
section `Specifying area fill attributes`_).

Latitude/Longitude or Longitude/Latitude?: The **-:** option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For geographical data, the first column is expected to contain
longitudes and the second to contain latitudes. To reverse this
expectation you must apply the **-:** option. Optionally, append **i**
or **o** to restrict the effect to input or output only. Note that
command line arguments that may take geographic coordinates (e.g.,
**-R**) *always* expect longitude before latitude. Also, geographical
grids are expected to have the longitude as first (minor) dimension.

Command line history
--------------------

GMT programs "remember" the standardized command line options (See
Section `Standardized command line options`_) given during their previous invocations and this
provides a shorthand notation for complex options. For example, if a
basemap was created with an oblique Mercator projection, specified as

    ::

     -Joc170W/25:30S/33W/56:20N/1:500000

then a subsequent :doc:`plot` command to plot
symbols only needs to state **-J**\ o in order to activate the same
projection. In contrast, note that **-J** by itself will pick the most
recently used projection. Previous commands are maintained in the file ``gmt.history``,
of which there will be one in each directory you run the programs from.
This is handy if you create separate directories for separate projects
since chances are that data manipulations and plotting for each project
will share many of the same options. Note that an option spelled out on
the command line will always override the previous entry in the ``gmt.history`` file and, if
execution is successful, will replace this entry as the previous option
argument in the ``gmt.history`` file. If you call several GMT modules piped together
then GMT cannot guarantee that the ``gmt.history`` file is processed in the intended
order from left to right. The only guarantee is that the file will not
be clobbered since GMT uses advisory file locking. The uncertainty in
processing order makes the use of shorthands in pipes unreliable. We
therefore recommend that you only use shorthands in single process
command lines, and spell out the full command option when using chains
of commands connected with pipes.  The history can be cleared by running
**gmt clear history**.

Usage messages, syntax- and general error messages
--------------------------------------------------

Each program carries a usage message. If you enter the program name
without any arguments, the program will write the complete usage message
to standard error (your screen, unless you redirect it). This message
explains in detail what all the valid arguments are. If you enter the
program name followed by a *hyphen* (-) only you will get a shorter
version which only shows the command line syntax and no detailed
explanations. If you incorrectly specify an option or omit a required
option, the program will produce syntax errors and explain what the
correct syntax for these options should be. If an error occurs during
the running of a program, the program will in some cases recognize this
and give you an error message. Usually this will also terminate the run.
The error messages generally begin with the name of the program in which
the error occurred; if you have several programs piped together this
tells you where the trouble is.

Standard input or file, header records
--------------------------------------

Most of the programs which expect table data input can read either
standard input or input in one or several files. These programs will try
to read *stdin* unless you type the filename(s) on the command line
without the above hyphens. (If the program sees a hyphen, it reads the
next character as an instruction; if an argument begins without a
hyphen, it tries to open this argument as a filename).  This feature
allows you to connect programs with pipes if you like.
To give numerous input files you can either list them all (file1.txt file2.txt ...),
use UNIX wild cards (file*.txt), or make a simple *listfile* with the
names of all your datafiles (one per line) and then use the special
=\ *filelist* mechanism to specify the input files to a module.
This allows GMT modules to obtain the input file names from *filelist*.
If your input is
ASCII and has one or more header records that do not begin with #, you
must use the **-h** option (see Section `Header data records: The -h
option`_). ASCII files may in many cases also contain segment-headers
separating data segments. These are called "multi-segment files". For
binary table data the **-h** option may specify how many bytes should be
skipped before the data section is reached. Binary files may also
contain segment-headers separating data segments. These segment-headers
are simply data records whose fields are all set to NaN; see Chapter
`GMT file formats`_ for complete documentation.

If filenames are given for reading, GMT programs will first look for
them in the current directory. If the file is not found, the programs
will look in other directories pointed to by the
:ref:`directory parameters <DIR Parameters>` **DIR_DATA** and **DIR_CACHE**
or by the environmental parameters **$GMT_USERDIR**, **$GMT_CACHEDIR** and
**$GMT_DATADIR** (if set). They may be set by the user to point to
directories that contain data sets of general use, thus eliminating the
need to specify a full path to these files. Usually, the **DIR_DATA**
directory will hold data sets of a general nature (tables, grids),
whereas the **$GMT_USERDIR** directory (its default value is $HOME/.gmt)
may hold miscellaneous data sets more specific to the user; this directory
also stores GMT defaults, other configuration files and modern session directories as well as the
directory *server* which olds downloaded data sets from the GMT data server
The **DIR_CACHE** will typically contain other data files
downloaded when running tutorial or example scripts.  See :ref:`directory parameters <DIR Parameters>`
for details. Program output is always written to the current directory
unless a full path has been specified.

URLs and remote files
---------------------

Three classes of files are given special treatment in GMT.

#. Some data sets are ubiquitous and used by nearly all GMT users.
   At the moment this collection is limited to Earth relief grids.  If you specify
   a grid input named **@earth_relief_**\ *res* on a command line then
   such a grid will automatically be downloaded from the GMT Data Server and placed
   in the *server* directory under **$GMT_USERDIR** [~/.gmt].  The resolution *res* allows a choice among
   15 common grid spacings: 60m, 30m, 20m, 15m, 10m, 06m, 05m, 04m, 03m, 02m, 01m,
   30s, and 15s (with file sizes 111 kb, 376 kb, 782 kb, 1.3 Mb, 2.8 Mb, 7.5 Mb,
   11 Mb, 16 Mb, 27 Mb, 58 Mb, 214 Mb, 778 Mb, and 2.6 Gb respectively) as well
   as the SRTM tile resolutions 03s and 01s (6.8 Gb and 41 Gb for the whole set, respectively). Once
   one of these grids have been downloaded any future reference will simply obtain the
   file from **$GMT_USERDIR** (except if explicitly removed by the user).
   Note: The four highest resolutions are the original data sets SRTM15+, SRTM30+,
   ETOPO1 and ETOPO2V2.  Lower resolutions are spherically Gaussian-filtered versions
   of ETOPO1.  The SRTM (version 3) 1 and 3 arc-sec tiles are only available over land
   between 60 degrees south and north latitude and are stored as highly compressed JPEG2000
   tiles on the GMT server.  These are individually downloaded as requested, converted to netCDF
   grids and stored in subdirectories srtm1 and srtm3 under the server directory, and assembled
   into a seamless grid using :doc:`grdblend`. A tile is only downloaded and converted
   once (unless the user cleans the data directories).
#. If a file is given as a full URL, starting with **http://**, **https://**,
   or **ftp://**, then the file will be downloaded to **DIR_CACHE** and subsequently
   read from there (until removed by the user).  If the URL is actually a CGI Get
   command (i.e., ends in ?par=val1&par2=val2...) then we download the file
   each time we encounter the URL.
#. Demonstration files used in online documentation, example scripts, or even the
   large test suite may be given in the format @\ *filename*.  When such a file is
   encountered on the command line it is understood to be a short-hand representation
   of the full URL to *filename* on the GMT Cache Data site.
   Since this address may change over time we use the leading
   @ to simplify access to these files.  Such files will also be downloaded
   to **DIR_CACHE** and subsequently read from there (until removed by the user).
#. By default, remote files are downloaded from the SOEST data server.  However, you
   can override that selection by setting the environmental parameter **$GMT_DATA_URL** or
   the default setting for **GMT_DATA_URL**.  Alternatively, configure the CMake
   parameter GMT_DATA_URL at compile time.

The user cache (**DIR_CACHE**) and all its contents can be cleared any time
via the command **gmt clear cache**, while the server directory with downloaded data
can be cleared via the command **gmt clear data**.

Verbose operation
-----------------

Most of the programs take an optional **-V** argument which will run the
program in the "verbose" mode (see Section `Verbose feedback: The -V
option`_). Verbose will write to standard error information about the
progress of the operation you are running. Verbose reports things such
as counts of points read, names of data files processed, convergence of
iterative solutions, and the like. Since these messages are written to
*stderr*, the verbose talk remains separate from your data output. You
may optionally choose among five models of *verbosity*; each mode adds
more messages with an increasing level of details. The modes are

  **q** Complete silence, not even fatal error messages.

  **n** Fatal errors [Default].

  **c** Warnings about deprecated usage (if compiled for compatibility).

  **v** General Warnings.

  **l** Detailed progress and informational messages.

  **d** Debugging messages (mostly of interest to developers).

The verbosity is cumulative, i.e., mode **l** means all messages of mode
**n** as well. will be reported.

Program output
--------------

Most programs write their results, including PostScript plots, to
standard output. The exceptions are those which may create binary netCDF
grid files such as :doc:`surface` (due to the
design of netCDF a filename must be provided; however, alternative
binary output formats allowing piping are available; see Section
`Grid file format specifications`_).
Most operating systems let you can redirect
standard output to a file or pipe it into another process. Error
messages, usage messages, and verbose comments are written to standard
error in all cases. You can usually redirect standard error as well, if
you want to create a log file of what you are doing. The syntax for
redirection differ among the main shells (Bash and C-shell) and is a bit
limited in DOS.

Input data formats
------------------

Most of the time, GMT will know what kind of *x* and *y*
coordinates it is reading because you have selected a particular
coordinate transformation or map projection. However, there may be times
when you must explicitly specify what you are providing as input using
the **-f** switch. When binary input data are expected (**-bi**) you
must specify exactly the format of the records. However, for ASCII input
there are numerous ways to encode data coordinates (which may be
separated by white-space or commas). Valid input data are generally of
the same form as the arguments to the **-R** option (see
Section `Data domain or map region: The -R option`_), with additional flexibility for calendar data.
Geographical coordinates, for example, can be given in decimal degrees
(e.g., -123.45417) or in the
[±]\ *ddd*\ [:*mm*\ [:*ss*\ [*.xxx*]]][\ **W**\ \|\ **E**\ \|\ **S**\ \|\ **N**]
format (e.g., 123:27:15W). With **-fp** you may even supply projected
data like UTM coordinates.

Because of the widespread use of incompatible and ambiguous formats, the
processing of input date components is guided by the template
:ref:`FORMAT_DATE_IN <FORMAT_DATE_IN>` in your :doc:`gmt.conf` file; it is by default set to *yyyy-mm-dd*.
Y2K-challenged input data such as 29/05/89 can be processed by setting
:ref:`FORMAT_DATE_IN <FORMAT_DATE_IN>` to dd/mm/yy. A complete description of possible
formats is given in the :doc:`gmt.conf` man
page. The *clock* string is more standardized but issues like 12- or
24-hour clocks complicate matters as well as the presence or absence of
delimiters between fields. Thus, the processing of input clock
coordinates is guided by the template :ref:`FORMAT_CLOCK_IN <FORMAT_CLOCK_IN>` which
defaults to *hh:mm:ss.xxx*.

GMT programs that require a map projection argument will implicitly
know what kind of data to expect, and the input processing is done
accordingly. However, some programs that simply report on minimum and
maximum values or just do a reformatting of the data will in general not
know what to expect, and furthermore there is no way for the programs to
know what kind of data other columns (beyond the leading *x* and
*y* columns) contain. In such instances we must explicitly tell
GMT that we are feeding it data in the specific geographic or calendar
formats (floating point data are assumed by default). We specify the
data type via the **-f** option (which sets both input and output
formats; use **-fi** and **-fo** to set input and output separately).
For instance, to specify that the the first two columns are longitude
and latitude, and that the third column (e.g., *z*) is absolute
calendar time, we add **-fi**\ 0x,1y,2T to the command line. For more
details, see the man page for the program you need to use.

Output data formats
-------------------

The numerical output from GMT programs can be binary (when **-bo** is
used) or ASCII [Default]. In the latter case the issue of formatting
becomes important. GMT provides extensive machinery for allowing just
about any imaginable format to be used on output. Analogous to the
processing of input data, several templates guide the formatting
process. These are :ref:`FORMAT_DATE_OUT <FORMAT_DATE_OUT>` and :ref:`FORMAT_CLOCK_OUT <FORMAT_CLOCK_OUT>` for
calendar-time coordinates, :ref:`FORMAT_GEO_OUT <FORMAT_GEO_OUT>` for geographical
coordinates, and :ref:`FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT <FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT>` for generic floating point data.
In addition, the user have control over how columns are separated via
the :ref:`IO_COL_SEPARATOR <IO_COL_SEPARATOR>` parameter. Thus, as an example, it is possible
to create limited FORTRAN-style card records by setting
:ref:`FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT <FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT>` to %7.3lf and :ref:`IO_COL_SEPARATOR <IO_COL_SEPARATOR>` to none
[Default is tab].

PostScript features
---------------------

PostScript is a command language for driving graphics devices such as
laser printers. It is ASCII text which you can read and edit as you wish
(assuming you have some knowledge of the syntax). We prefer this to
binary metafile plot systems since such files cannot easily be modified
after they have been created. GMT programs also write many comments to
the plot file which make it easier for users to orient themselves should
they need to edit the file (e.g., % Start of x-axis) [16]_. All
GMT programs create PostScript code by calling the :doc:`PSL <postscriptlight>` plot
library (The user may call these functions from his/her own C or FORTRAN
plot programs. See the manual pages for :doc:`PSL <postscriptlight>` syntax). Although
GMT programs can create very individualized plot code, there will
always be cases not covered by these programs. Some knowledge of
PostScript will enable the user to add such features directly into the
plot file. By default, GMT will produce freeform PostScript output
with embedded printer directives. To produce Encapsulated
PostScript (EPS) that can be imported into graphics programs such as
**CorelDraw**, **Illustrator** or **InkScape** for further
embellishment, simply run gmt :doc:`psconvert`
**-Te**. See Chapter `Including GMT Graphics into your Documents`_ for an extensive discussion of converting
PostScript to other formats.

.. _-Wpen_attrib:

Specifying pen attributes
-------------------------

A pen in GMT has three attributes: *width*, *color*, and
*style*. Most programs will accept pen attributes in the form of an
option argument, with commas separating the given attributes, e.g.,

**-W**\ [*width*\ [**c\ \|\ i\ \|\ p**]],[*color*],[\ *style*\ [**c\ \|\ i\ \|\ p\ \|**]]

    *Width* is by default measured in points (1/72 of an inch). Append
    **c**, **i**, or **p** to specify pen width in cm, inch, or points,
    respectively. Minimum-thickness pens can be achieved by giving zero
    width. The result is device-dependent but typically means that as
    you zoom in on the feature in a display, the line thickness stays
    at the minimum. Finally, a few predefined
    pen names can be used: default, faint, and {thin, thick,
    fat}[er\ \|\ est], and obese. Table :ref:`pennames <tbl-pennames>` shows this
    list and the corresponding pen widths.

.. _tbl-pennames:

    +------------+---------+------------+--------+
    +============+=========+============+========+
    | faint      | 0       | thicker    | 1.5p   |
    +------------+---------+------------+--------+
    | default    | 0.25p   | thickest   | 2p     |
    +------------+---------+------------+--------+
    | thinnest   | 0.25p   | fat        | 3p     |
    +------------+---------+------------+--------+
    | thinner    | 0.50p   | fatter     | 6p     |
    +------------+---------+------------+--------+
    | thin       | 0.75p   | fattest    | 12p    |
    +------------+---------+------------+--------+
    | thick      | 1.0p    | obese      | 18p    |
    +------------+---------+------------+--------+

.. _color_attrib:

    The *color* can be specified in five different ways:

    #. Gray. Specify a *gray* shade in the range 0--255 (linearly going
       from black [0] to white [255]).

    #. RGB. Specify *r*/*g*/*b*, each ranging from 0--255. Here 0/0/0 is
       black, 255/255/255 is white, 255/0/0 is red, etc.

    #. HSV. Specify *hue*-*saturation*-*value*, with the former in the
       0--360 degree range while the latter two take on the range 0--1 [17]_.

    #. CMYK. Specify *cyan*/*magenta*/*yellow*/*black*, each ranging
       from 0--100%.

    #. Name. Specify one of 663 valid color names. Use **man
       gmtcolors** to list all valid names. A very small yet versatile
       subset consists of the 29 choices *white*, *black*, and
       [light\ \|\ dark]{*red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue,
       magenta, gray\ \|\ grey, brown*\ }. The color names are
       case-insensitive, so mixed upper and lower case can be used (like
       *DarkGreen*).

    The *style* attribute controls the appearance of the line. Giving "dotted" or "."
    yields a dotted line, whereas a dashed pen is requested with "dashed" or "-".
    Also combinations of dots and dashes, like ".-" for a dot-dashed
    line, are allowed. To override a default style and secure a solid line you can
    specify "solid" for style.  The lengths of dots and dashes are scaled
    relative to the pen width (dots has a length that equals the pen
    width while dashes are 8 times as long; gaps between segments are 4
    times the pen width). For more detailed attributes including exact
    dimensions you may specify *string*:*offset*, where *string* is a
    series of numbers separated by underscores. These numbers represent
    a pattern by indicating the length of line segments and the gap
    between segments. The *offset* phase-shifts the pattern from the
    beginning the line. For example, if you want a yellow line of width
    0.1 cm that alternates between long dashes (4 points), an 8 point
    gap, then a 5 point dash, then another 8 point gap, with pattern
    offset by 2 points from the origin, specify
    **-W**\ 0.1c,yellow,4_8_5_8:2p. Just as with pen width, the
    default style units are points, but can also be explicitly specified
    in cm, inch, or points (see *width* discussion above).

Table :ref:`penex <tbl-penex>` contains additional examples of pen specifications
suitable for, say, :doc:`plot`.

.. _tbl-penex:

+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
+===============================+=====================================================+
| **-W**\ 0.5p                  | 0.5 point wide line of default color and style      |
+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| **-W**\ green                 | Green line with default width and style             |
+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| **-W**\ thin,red,-            | Dashed, thin red line                               |
+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| **-W**\ fat,.                 | Fat dotted line with default color                  |
+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| **-W**\ 0.1c,120-1-1          | Green (in h-s-v) pen, 1 mm thick                    |
+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| **-W**\ faint,100/0/0/0,..-   | Very thin, cyan (in c/m/y/k), dot-dot-dashed line   |
+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

In addition to these pen settings there are several
PostScript settings that can affect the appearance of lines. These are
controlled via the GMT defaults settings :ref:`PS_LINE_CAP <PS_LINE_CAP>`,
:ref:`PS_LINE_JOIN <PS_LINE_JOIN>`, and :ref:`PS_MITER_LIMIT <PS_MITER_LIMIT>`. They determine how a line
segment ending is rendered, be it at the termination of a solid line or
at the end of all dashed line segments making up a line, and how a
straight lines of finite thickness should behave when joined at a common
point. By default, line segments have rectangular ends, but this can
change to give rounded ends. When :ref:`PS_LINE_CAP <PS_LINE_CAP>` is set to round the
a segment length of zero will appear as a circle. This can be used to
created circular dotted lines, and by manipulating the phase shift in
the *style* attribute and plotting the same line twice one can even
alternate the color of adjacent items.
Figure :ref:`Line appearance <Line_appearance>` shows various lines made in this
fashion. See the :doc:`gmt.conf` man page for more information.

.. _Line_appearance:

   Line appearance can be varied by using :ref:`PS_LINE_CAP <PS_LINE_CAP>`

Specifying line attributes
--------------------------

A line is drawn with the texture provided by the chosen pen (`Specifying pen attributes`_).
However, depending on the module, a line also may have other attributes that can be changed in some modules.
Given as modifiers to a pen specification, one or more modifiers may be appended to a pen
specification. The line attribute modifiers are:


* **+o**\ *offset*\ [**u**]
    Lines are normally drawn from the beginning to the end point. You can modify this behavior
    by requesting a gap between these terminal points and the start and end of the
    visible line.  Do this by specifying the desired offset between the terminal point and the
    start of the visible line.  Unless you are giving distances in Cartesian data units,
    please append the distance unit, **u**.  Depending on your desired effect, you can append
    plot distance units (i.e., **c**\ m, **i**\ nch, **p**\ oint; Section `Length units`_)) or map distance units,
    such as **k**\ m, **d**\ egrees, and many other standard distance units listed in
    Section `GMT units`_.  If only one offset is given then it applies equally to both ends of
    the line.  Give two slash-separated distances to indicate different offsets at the
    beginning and end of the line (and use 0 to indicate no offset at one end).

.. _Line_offset:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_lineoffset.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   The thin red line shows an original line segment, whereas the 2-point thick pen illustrates the effect
   of plotting the same line while requesting offsets of 1 cm at the beginning and 500 km
   at the end, via **-W**\ 2p\ **+o**\ 1c/500k.

* **+s**
    Normally, all PostScript line drawing is implemented as a linear spline, i.e., we simply
    draw straight line-segments between the given data points.  Use this modifier to render the
    line using Bezier splines for a smoother curve.

.. _Line_bezier:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_bezier.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   (left) Normal plotting of line given input points (red circles) via **-W**\ 2p. (right) Letting
   the points be interpolated by a Bezier cubic spline via **-W**\ 2p\ **+s**.

* **+v**\ [**b**\ \|\ **e**]\ *vspecs*
    By default, lines are normally drawn from start to end.  Using the **+v** modifier you can
    place arrow-heads pointing outward at one (or both) ends of the line.  Use **+v** if you
    want the same vector attributes for both ends, or use **+vb** and **+ve** to specify a vector
    only at the beginning or end of the line, respectively.  Finally, these two modifiers may both be given
    to specify different attributes for the two vectors.  The vector specification is very rich
    and you may place other symbols, such as circle, square, or a terminal cross-line, in lieu of the
    vector head (see :doc:`plot` for more details).

.. _Line_vector:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_linearrow.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Same line as above but now we have requested a blue vector head at the end of the line and a
   red circle at the beginning of the line with **-W**\ 2p\ **+o**\ 1c/500k\ **+vb**\ 0.2i\ **+g**\ red\ **+p**\ faint\ **+b**\ c\ **+ve**\ 0.3i\ **+g**\ blue.
   Note that we also prescribed the line offsets in addition to the symbol endings.

.. _-Gfill_attrib:

Specifying area fill attributes
-------------------------------

Many plotting programs will allow the user to draw filled polygons or
symbols. The fill specification may take two forms:

**-G**\ *fill*

**-Gp**\ *pattern*\ [**+b**\ *color*][**+f**\ *color*][**+r**\ *dpi*]

fill:
    In the first case we may specify a *gray* shade (0--255), RGB color
    (*r*/*g*/*b* all in the 0--255 range or in hexadecimal *#rrggbb*),
    HSV color (*hue*-*saturation*-*value* in the 0--360, 0--1, 0--1 range),
    CMYK color (*cyan*/*magenta*/*yellow*/*black*, each ranging from
    0--100%), or a valid color *name*; in that respect it is similar to
    specifying the pen color settings (see pen color discussion under
    Section `Specifying pen attributes`_).

pattern:
    The second form allows us to use a predefined bit-image pattern.
    *pattern* can either be a number in the range 1--90 or the name of a
    1-, 8-, or 24-bit image raster file. The former will result in one of
    the 90 predefined 64 x 64 bit-patterns provided with GMT and
    reproduced in Chapter `Predefined Bit and Hachure Patterns in GMT`_.
    The latter allows the user to create
    customized, repeating images using image raster files.
    The optional **+r**\ *dpi* modifier sets the resolution of this image on the page;
    the area fill is thus made up of a series of these "tiles".  The
    default resolution is 1200.  By specifying upper case **-GP**
    instead of **-Gp** the image will be bit-reversed, i.e., white and
    black areas will be interchanged (only applies to 1-bit images or
    predefined bit-image patterns). For these patterns and other 1-bit
    images one may specify alternative background and foreground colors
    (by appending **+b**\ *color* and/or **+f**\ *color*) that will replace
    the default white and black pixels, respectively. Setting one of the
    fore- or background colors to - yields a *transparent* image where
    only the back- *or* foreground pixels will be painted.

Due to PostScript implementation limitations the raster images used
with **-G** must be less than 146 x 146 pixels in size; for larger
images see :doc:`image`. The format of Sun raster files [18]_ is
outlined in Chapter `GMT file formats`_. However, if you built GMT
with GDAL then other image formats can be used as well. Note that under
PostScript Level 1 the patterns are filled by using the polygon as a
*clip path*. Complex clip paths may require more memory than the
PostScript interpreter has been assigned. There is therefore the
possibility that some PostScript interpreters (especially those
supplied with older laserwriters) will run out of memory and abort.
Should that occur we recommend that you use a regular gray-shade fill
instead of the patterns. Installing more memory in your printer *may or
may not* solve the problem!

Table :ref:`fillex <tbl-fillex>` contains a few examples of fill specifications.

.. _tbl-fillex:

Specifying Fonts
----------------

The fonts used by GMT are typically set indirectly via the
GMT defaults parameters. However, some programs, like
:doc:`text` may wish to have this
information passed directly. A font is specified by a comma-delimited
attribute list of *size*, *fonttype* and *fill*, each of which is
optional. The *size* is the font size (usually in points) but **c**,
**i** or **p** can be added to indicate a specific unit. The *fonttype*
is the name (case sensitive!) of the font or its equivalent numerical ID
(e.g., Helvetica-Bold or 1). *fill* specifies the gray shade, color or
pattern of the text (see section `Specifying area fill attributes`_ above). Optionally, you may
append **=**\ *pen* to the *fill* value in order to draw the text
outline with the specified *pen*; if used you may optionally skip the
filling of the text by setting *fill* to **-**. If any of the attributes
is omitted their default or previous setting will be retained. See
Chapter `PostScript fonts used by GMT`_ for a list of all fonts recognized by GMT.

Stroke, Fill and Font Transparency
----------------------------------

The PostScript language has no built-in mechanism for transparency.
However, PostScript extensions make it possible to request
transparency, and tools that can render such extensions will produce
transparency effects. We specify transparency in percent: 0 is opaque
[Default] while 100 is fully transparent (i.e., the feature will be invisible). As
noted in section `Layer PDF transparency: The -t option`_, we can control transparency on a
layer-by-layer basis using the **-t** option. However, we may also set
transparency as an attribute of stroke or fill (including for fonts)
settings. Here, transparency is requested by appending @\ *transparency*
to colors or pattern fills. The transparency *mode* can be changed by
using the GMT default parameter :ref:`PS_TRANSPARENCY <PS_TRANSPARENCY>`; the default is
Normal but you can choose among Color, ColorBurn, ColorDodge, Darken,
Difference, Exclusion, HardLight, Hue, Lighten, Luminosity, Multiply,
Normal, Overlay, Saturation, SoftLight, and Screen. For more
information, see for instance (search online for) the Adobe pdfmark
Reference Manual. Most printers and many PostScript viewers can
neither print nor show transparency. They will simply ignore your
attempt to create transparency and will plot any material as opaque.
Ghostscript and its derivatives such as GMT's
:doc:`psconvert` support transparency (if
compiled with the correct build option). Note: If you use **Acrobat
Distiller** to create a PDF file you must first change some settings to
make transparency effective: change the parameter /AllowTransparency to
true in your \*.joboptions file.

Placement of text
-----------------

Many text labels placed on maps are part of the standard basemap
machinery (e.g., annotations, axis labels, plot titles) and GMT
automatically takes care of where these are placed and how they
are justified.  However, when you wish to add extra text to a plot
in locations of your choice you will need to understand how we
reference text to locations on the map.  Figure :ref:`Text justification <Text_justify>`
discusses the various ways to do this.

.. _Text_justify:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_pstext_justify.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Text strings are placed on maps by associating an *anchor* point on
   the string with a *reference* point on the map.  Nine anchor points
   relative to any text string may be specified by combining any of
   three letter codes for horizontal (**L**\ eft, **C**\ enter, **R**\ ight)
   and vertical (**T**\ op, **M**\ iddle, **B**\ ottom) alignments.

Notice how the anchor points refers to the text baseline and do not change
for text whose letters extend below the baseline.

The concept of anchor points extends to entire text paragraphs that you
may want to typeset with :doc:`text`.

A related point involves the
footprint of the text and any background panel on the map.  We determine
the bounding box for any text string, but very often we wish to extend this
box outwards to allow for some *clearance* between the text and the space
surrounding it.  Programs that allows for such clearance will let you
specify offsets *dx* and *dy* that is used to enlarge the bounding box,
as illustrated in Figure :ref:`Text clearance <Text_clearance>`.

.. _Text_clearance:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_pstext_clearance.*
   :width: 300 px
   :align: center

   The bounding box of any text string can be enlarged by specifying the
   adjustments *dx* and *dy* in the horizontal and vertical dimension.  The shape of the
   bounding box can be modified as well, including rounded or convex
   rectangles.  Here we have chosen a rounded rectangle, requiring the
   additional specification of a corner radius, *r*.

.. _CPT_section:

Color palette tables
--------------------

Several programs need to relate user data to colors, shades, or even patterns.
For instance, programs that read 2-D gridded data sets and
create colored images or shaded reliefs  need to be told what colors to
use and over what *z*-range each color applies. Other programs may need
to associate a user value with a color to be applied to a symbol, line,
or polygon.  This is the purpose of the color palette table (CPT).  For
most applications, you will simply create a CPT using the tool
:doc:`makecpt` which will take an existing *dynamic* master
color table and stretch it to fit your chosen data range, or use
:doc:`grd2cpt` to build a CPT based on
the data distribution in one or more given grid files. However, in rare
situations you may need to make a CPT by hand or using text tools
like **awk** or **perl**. Finally, if you have your own preferred color
table you can convert it into a dynamic CPT and place it in your GMT
user directory and it will be found and behave like other GMT master CPTs.

Color palette tables (CPT) comes in two flavors: (1) Those designed to
work with categorical data (e.g., data where interpolation of values is
undefined) and (2) those designed for regular, continuously-varying
data. In both cases the *fill* information follows the format given in
Section `Specifying area fill attributes`_. The z-values in CPTs can
be scaled by using the **+u**\ \|\ **U**\ *unit* mechanism.  Append these
modifiers to your CPT names when used in GMT commands.  The **+u**\ *unit*
modifier will scale z *from unit to* meters, while **+U**\ *unit* does
the inverse (scale z *from meters to unit*).

Since GMT supports several coordinate systems for color specification,
many master (or user) CPTs will contain the special comment

| ``# COLOR_MODEL = model``

where *model* specifies how the color-values in the CPT should be interpreted.
By default we assume colors are given as red/green/blue triplets (each in the
0-255 range) separated by
slashes (model = *rgb*), but alternative representations are the HSV system
of specifying hue-saturation-value triplets (with hue in 0-360 range and
saturation and value ranging from 0-1) separated by hyphens (model = *hsv*),
or the CMYK system of specifying cyan/magenta/yellow/black quadruples in percent,
separated by slashes (model = *cmyk*).

Categorical CPTs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Categorical data are information on which normal numerical operations
are not defined. As an example, consider various land classifications
(desert, forest, glacier, etc.) and it is clear that even if we assigned
a numerical value to these categories (e.g., desert = 1, forest = 2,
etc) it would be meaningless to compute average values (what would 1.5
mean?). For such data a special format of the CPTs are provided.
Here, each category is assigned a unique key, a color or pattern, and an
optional label (usually the category name) marked by a leading
semi-colon. Keys must be monotonically increasing but do not need to be
consecutive. The format is

+-----------------+--------+--------------+
| key\ :sub:`1`   | *Fill* | [;\ *label*] |
+-----------------+--------+--------------+
| ...             |        |              |
+-----------------+--------+--------------+
| key\ :sub:`n`   | *Fill* | [;\ *label*] |
+-----------------+--------+--------------+

For usage with points, lines, and polygons, the keys may be text (single words),
and then GMT will use strings to find the corresponding *Fill* value. Strings
may be supplied as trailing text in data files (for points) or via the **-Z**\ *category*
option in multiple segment headers (or set via **-a**\ *Z*\ =*aspatialname*).
If any of your keys are called B, F, or N you must escape them with a leading backslash
to avoid confusion with the flags for background, foreground and NaN colors.
The *Fill* information follows the format given in Section `Specifying area fill attributes`_.
For categorical data, background color or foreground color do not apply. The not-a-number (NaN)
color (for *key*-values not found or blank) is defined in the :doc:`gmt.conf` file, but it can be
overridden by the statement

+-----+---------------------+
| N   | Fill\ :sub:`nan`    |
+-----+---------------------+

Regular CPTs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suitable for continuous data types and allowing for color
interpolations, the format of the regular CPTs is:

+---------------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------+----------+--------------+
| z\ :sub:`0`   | Color\ :sub:`min` | z\ :sub:`1`   | Color\ :sub:`max` | [**A**]  | [;\ *label*] |
+---------------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------+----------+--------------+
| ...                                                                                             |
+---------------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------+----------+--------------+
| z\ :sub:`n-2` | Color\ :sub:`min` | z\ :sub:`n-1` | Color\ :sub:`max` | [**A**]  | [;\ *label*] |
+---------------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------+----------+--------------+


Thus, for each "*z*-slice", defined as the interval between two
boundaries (e.g., :math:`z_0` to :math:`z_1`), the color can be
constant (by letting Color\ :math:`_{max}` = Color\ :math:`_{min}` or -)
or a continuous, linear function of *z*. If patterns are used then the
second (max) pattern must be set to -. The optional flag **A** is used
to indicate annotation of the color scale when plotted using
:doc:`colorbar`. The optional flag **A** may
be **L**, **U**, or **B** to select annotation of the lower, upper, or
both limits of the particular *z*-slice, respectively. However,
the standard **-B** option can be used by
:doc:`colorbar` to affect annotation and
ticking of color scales. Just as other GMT programs, the *stride* can
be omitted to determine the annotation and tick interval automatically
(e.g., **-Baf**). The optional semicolon followed by a text label will
make :doc:`colorbar`, when used with the
**-L** option, place the supplied label instead of formatted *z*-values.

The background color (for *z*-values < :math:`z_0`), foreground color (for *z*-values >
:math:`z_{n-1}`), and not-a-number (NaN) color (for *z*-values =
NaN) are all defined in the :doc:`gmt.conf` file, but can be overridden by the
statements

+-----+---------------------+
| B   | Fill\ :sub:`back`   |
+-----+---------------------+
| F   | Fill\ :sub:`fore`   |
+-----+---------------------+
| N   | Fill\ :sub:`nan`    |
+-----+---------------------+

which can be inserted into the beginning or end of the CPT. If you
prefer the HSV system, set the :doc:`gmt.conf` parameter accordingly and replace red,
green, blue with hue, saturation, value. Color palette tables that
contain gray-shades only may replace the *r/g/b* triplets with a single
gray-shade in the 0--255 range. For CMYK, give *c/m/y/k* values in the
0--100 range.

A few programs (i.e., those that plot polygons such as
:doc:`grdview`, :doc:`colorbar`,
:doc:`plot` and
:doc:`plot3d`) can accept pattern fills instead
of gray-shades. You must specify the pattern as in Section `Specifying area fill attributes`_
(no leading **-G** of course), and only the first pattern (for low
*z*) is used (we cannot interpolate between patterns). Finally,
some programs let you skip features whose *z*-slice in the CPT
file has gray-shades set to -. As an example, consider

+-----+----------+------+-----------+
| 30  | p16+r200 | 80   | \-        |
+-----+----------+------+-----------+
| 80  | \-       | 100  | \-        |
+-----+----------+------+-----------+
| 100 | 200/0/0  | 200  | 255/255/0 |
+-----+----------+------+-----------+
| 200 | yellow   | 300  | green     |
+-----+----------+------+-----------+

where slice 30 < z < 80 is painted with pattern # 16 at 200 dpi,
slice 80 < z < 100 is skipped, slice 100 < z < 200 is
painted in a range of dark red to yellow, whereas the slice
200 < z < 300 will linearly yield colors from yellow to green,
depending on the actual value of *z*.

Some programs like :doc:`grdimage` and
:doc:`grdview` apply artificial illumination
to achieve shaded relief maps. This is typically done by finding the
directional gradient in the direction of the artificial light source and
scaling the gradients to have approximately a normal distribution on the
interval [-1,+1]. These intensities are used to add "white" or "black"
to the color as defined by the *z*-values and the CPT. An intensity
of zero leaves the color unchanged. Higher values will brighten the
color, lower values will darken it, all without changing the original
hue of the color (see Chapter `Color Space: The Final Frontier`_ for more details). The
illumination is decoupled from the data grid file in that a separate
grid file holding intensities in the [-1,+1] range must be provided.
Such intensity files can be derived from the data grid using
:doc:`grdgradient` and modified with
:doc:`grdhisteq`, but could equally well be
a separate data set. E.g., some side-scan sonar systems collect both
bathymetry and backscatter intensities, and one may want to use the
latter information to specify the illumination of the colors defined by
the former. Similarly, one could portray magnetic anomalies superimposed
on topography by using the former for colors and the latter for shading.

Master (dynamic) CPTs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CPTs distributed with GMT are *dynamic*.  This means they have several
special properties that modify the behavior of programs that use them.
All dynamic CPTs are normalized in one of two ways: If a CPT was designed
to behave differently across a *hinge* value (e.g., a CPT designed specifically
for topographic relief may include a discontinuity in color across the
coastline at *z = 0*), then the CPT's *z*-values will range from -1, via 0
at the hinge, to +1 at the other end.  The hinge value is specified via the special
comment

| ``# HINGE = <hinge-value>``

CPTs without a hinge are instead normalized with *z*-values from 0 to 1.
Dynamic CPTs will need to be stretched to the user's preferred range, and there
are two modes of such scaling: Some CPTs designed for a specific application
(again, the topographic relief is a good example) have a *default range*
specified in the master table via the special comment


| ``# RANGE = <zmin/zmax>``

and when used by applications the normalized *z*-values will be stretched to reflect
this natural range.  In contrast, CPTs without a natural range are instead
stretched to fit the range of the data in question (e.g., a grid's range).
Exceptions to these rules are implemented in the two CPT-producing modules
:doc:`makecpt` and :doc:`grd2cpt`, both of which can read dynamic CPTs
and produce *static* CPTs satisfying a user's specific range needs.  These
tools can also read static CPTs where the new range must be specified (or computed
from data), reversing the order of colors, and even isolating a section
of an incoming CPT.  Here, :doc:`makecpt` can be told the range of compute it from data tables
while :doc:`grd2cpt` can derive the range from one or more grids.

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_hinge.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   The top color bar is a dynamic master CPT (here, globe) with a hinge at sea level and
   a natural range from -10,000 to +10,000 meters. However, our data range
   is asymmetrical, going from -8,000 meter depths up to +3,000 meter elevations.
   Because of the hinge, the two sides of the CPT will be stretched separately
   to honor the desired range while utilizing the full color range.

Cyclic (wrapped) CPTs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any color table you produce can be turned into a cyclic or *wrapped* color table.
This is performed by adding the **-Ww** option when running :doc:`makecpt` or
:doc:`grd2cpt`.  This option simply adds the special comment

| ``# CYCLIC``

to the color table and then GMT knows that when looking up a color from a *z*
value it will remove an integer multiple of the *z*-range represented by the
color table so that we are always inside the range of the color table.  This
means that the fore- and back-ground colors can never be activated.  Wrapped
color tables are useful for highlighting small changes.

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_cyclic.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Cyclic color bars are indicated by a cycle symbol on the left side of the bar.

.. _manipulating_CPTs:

Manipulating CPTs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many ways to turn a master CPT into a custom CPT that works for your
particular data range.  The tools :doc:`makecpt` and :doc:`grd2cpt` allow
several types of transformations to take place:

    #. You can reverse the *z*-direction of the CPT using option **-Iz**.
       This is useful when your data use a different convention for
       positive and negative (e.g., perhaps using positive depths instead of
       negative relief).
    #. You can invert the order of the colors in the CPT using option **-Ic**.
       This is different from the previous option in that only the colors
       are rearranged (it is also possible to issue **-Icz** to combine both effects.)
    #. You can select just a subset of a master CPT with **-G**, in effect creating
       a modified master CPT that can be scaled further.
    #. Finally, you can scale and translate the (modified) master CPT range to
       your actual data range or a sub-range thereof.

The order of these transformations is important.  For instance, if **-Iz** is given
then all other *z*-values need to be referred to the new sign convention. For most
applications only the last transformation is needed.

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_CPTscale.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Examples of two user CPTs for the range -0.5 to 3 created from the same master.  One (left) extracted a
   subset of the master before scaling while the other (right) used the entire range.

The Drawing of Vectors
----------------------

GMT supports plotting vectors in various forms. A vector is one of
many symbols that may be plotted by :doc:`plot`
and :doc:`plot3d`, is the main feature in
:doc:`grdvector`, and is indirectly used by
other programs. All vectors plotted by GMT consist of two separate
parts: The vector line (controlled by the chosen pen attributes) and the
optional vector head(s) (controlled by the chosen fill). We distinguish
between three types of vectors:

#. Cartesian vectors are plotted as straight lines. They can be
   specified by a start point and the direction and length (in map
   units) of the vector, or by its beginning and end point. They may
   also be specified giving the azimuth and length (in km) instead.

#. Circular vectors are (as the name implies) drawn as circular arcs and
   can be used to indicate opening angles. It accepts an origin, a
   radius, and the beginning and end angles.

#. Geo-vectors are drawn using great circle arcs. They are specified by
   a beginning point and the azimuth and length (in km) of the vector,
   or by its beginning and end point.

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_arrows.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Examples of Cartesian (left), circular (middle), and geo-vectors (right)
   for different attribute specifications. Note that both full and half
   arrow-heads can be specified, as well as no head at all.

There are numerous attributes you can modify, including how the vector
should be justified relative to the given point (beginning, center, or
end), where heads (if any) should be placed, if the head should just be
the left or right half, if the vector attributes should shrink for
vectors whose length are less than a given cutoff length, and the size
and shape of the head. These attributes are detailed further in the
relevant manual pages.

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_arrows_types.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Examples of different vector heads and attributes.  The default is the standard
   triangular arrow head, which can be modified by adjusting the apex angle [30] or
   changing its shape via the :ref:`MAP_VECTOR_SHAPE <MAP_VECTOR_SHAPE>` setting.
   Other vector heads are the circle (**c**), the terminal line (**t**), the
   arrow fin (**i**) and the plain head (**A**) and tail (**I**); the last two
   are line-drawings only and cannot be filled.

.. _Char-esc-seq:

Character escape sequences
--------------------------

For annotation labels or text strings plotted with
:doc:`text`, GMT provides several escape
sequences that allow the user to temporarily switch to the symbol font,
turn on sub- or superscript, etc., within words. These conditions are
toggled on/off by the escape sequence @\ **x**, where **x** can be one
of several types. The escape sequences recognized in GMT are listed in
Table :ref:`escape <tbl-escape>`. Only one level of sub- or superscript is supported.
Note that under Windows the percent symbol indicates a batch variable,
hence you must use two percent-signs for each one required in the escape
sequence for font switching.

.. _tbl-escape:

+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
+===================+================================================================+
| @~                | Turns symbol font on or off                                    |
+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| @+                | Turns superscript on or off                                    |
+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| @-                | Turns subscript on or off                                      |
+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| @#                | Turns small caps on or off                                     |
+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| @\_               | Turns underline on or off                                      |
+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| @%\ *fontno*\ %   | Switches to another font; @%% resets to previous font          |
+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| @:\ *size*:       | Switches to another font size; @:: resets to previous size     |
+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| @;\ *color*;      | Switches to another font color; @;; resets to previous color   |
+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| @!                | Creates one composite character of the next two characters     |
+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| @.                | Prints the degree symbol                                       |
+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| @@                | Prints the @ sign itself                                       |
+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

Shorthand notation for a few special European characters has also been added (for others
you must use the full octal code):


+----------+------------+----------+------------+
| *Code*   | *Effect*   | *Code*   | *Effect*   |
+==========+============+==========+============+
| @E       | Æ          | @e       | æ          |
+----------+------------+----------+------------+
| @O       | Ø          | @o       | ø          |
+----------+------------+----------+------------+
| @A       | Å          | @a       | å          |
+----------+------------+----------+------------+
| @C       | Ç          | @c       | ç          |
+----------+------------+----------+------------+
| @N       | Ñ          | @n       | ñ          |
+----------+------------+----------+------------+
| @U       | Ü          | @u       | ü          |
+----------+------------+----------+------------+
| @s       | ß          | @i       | í          |
+----------+------------+----------+------------+

However, if your input text contains UTF-8 code characters (e.g., ü, Î)
and you select the ISOLatin1+ character encoding then GMT will substitute
the correct PostScript octal codes for you automatically.

PostScript fonts used in GMT may be re-encoded to include several
accented characters used in many European languages. To access these,
you must specify the full octal code \\xxx allowed for
your choice of character encodings determined by the
:ref:`PS_CHAR_ENCODING <PS_CHAR_ENCODING>` setting described in the
:doc:`gmt.conf` man page. Only the special
characters belonging to a particular encoding will be available. Many
characters not directly available by using single octal codes may be
constructed with the composite character mechanism @!.

Some examples of escape sequences and embedded octal codes in
GMT strings using the Standard+ encoding:

| ``2@~p@~r@+2@+h@-0@- E\363tv\363s`` = 2\ :math:`\pi r^2h_0` Eötvös
| ``10@+-3 @Angstr@om`` = 10\ :math:`^{-3}` Ångstrøm
| ``Stresses are @~s@~@+*@+@-xx@- MPa`` = Stresses are :math:`\sigma^{*}_{xx}` MPa
| ``Se@nor Gar@con`` = Señor Garçon
| ``M@!\305anoa stra@se`` = Manoa straße
| ``A@\#cceleration@\# (ms@+-2@+)`` = ACCELERATION

The option in :doc:`text` to draw a
rectangle surrounding the text will not work for strings with escape
sequences. A chart of characters and their octal codes is given in
Chapter `Chart of Octal Codes for Characters`_.

.. _GMT_Embellishments:

Plot embellishments
-------------------

Apart from visualizing your data sets, GMT maps can also be embellished in several ways.
The 9 embellishments currently available are

*  **Map scale** showing the true scale at some location(s) on the map.

*  **Directional rose** showing true north and other cardinal directions.

*  **Magnetic rose** showing magnetic north and declination deviations.

*  **Color bar** relating the colors of your image to the data values.

*  **Map legend** showing the meaning of the symbols on your map.

*  **Image overlay** of raster images or EPS figures (e.g., institutional logos, photos, etc.).

*  **GMT logo** overlay.

*  **Map inset** showing perhaps the location of your detailed area in a regional or global context.

*  **Vertical scale** showing the vertical scale of anomalies on a map.

Each of these features share a common system for specifying the location on the plot where the
feature will be placed.  They also share a common way for specifying the placement of a rectangular
panel behind the feature (to provide a uniform background, for instance).  Thus, before we discuss
the different features in more detail we will first review the "reference point/anchor point"
system used by GMT to specify such locations in relation to the underlying map, and then discuss
the background panel attribute settings.

Reference and anchor point specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_anchor.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   The placement of a map feature (here represented by a green rectangle) in relation
   to the underlying map.  The nine named *reference* points (blue circles) on the map perimeter (and center)
   can be used to specify a location.  Using the same system of nine points on the map feature
   (cyan circles) we select one of these as our *anchor* point (here TL, indicated by the orange square).
   The anchor point can optionally be shifted away from the reference point by an amount *dx/dy* in the direction
   implied by the anchor point (in this case to the top and left), yielding the adjusted
   anchor point (red square).
   The feature is then placed such that its adjusted anchor point matches the reference point.

Placing a feature on the map means selecting a *reference* point somewhere on the map, an
*anchor* point somewhere on the feature, and then positioning the feature so that the two points overlap.
It may be helpful to consider the analog of a boat dropping an anchor: The boat navigates to the
reference point and then, depending on where on the boat the anchor is located, moves so that the
anchor connection point overlies the reference point, then drops the anchor.
There are four different ways to specify the reference point on a map, allowing for complete freedom
to select any location inside or outside the map.  The reference point syntax is [**g**\ \|\ **j**\ \|\ **J**\ \|\ **n**\ \|\ **x**]\ *refpoint*;
the five codes **g**\ \|\ **j**\ \|\ **J**\ \|\ **n**\ \|\ **x** refer to the five ways:

#. [**g**] Specify *refpoint* using *data* coordinates, e.g., the longitude and latitude of the reference point.
   This mechanism is useful when you want to tie the location of the feature to an actual point
   best described by data coordinates.  An example of such a reference point might
   be **g**\ 135W/20N.

#. [**j**] Specify *refpoint* using one of the nine *justification codes*, equivalent to the justification
   codes for placing text strings in :doc:`text`.  This mechanism is illustrated in the figure above and
   is the preferred mechanism when you just want to place the feature **inside** the basemap at
   one of the corners or centered at one of the sides (or even smack in the middle).  Justification codes
   are a combination of a horizontal (**L**, **C**, **R**) and a vertical (**T**, **M**, **B**) code.
   An example of such a reference point might be **j**\ TL. When used, the anchor point on the map feature
   will default to the same justification, i.e., TL in this example.

#. [**J**] This is the same as **j** except it implies that the default anchor point is the mirror opposite of the
   justification code. Thus, when using **J**\ TL, the anchor point on the map feature will default to BR.
   This is practical for features that are drawn **outside** of the basemap (like color bars often are).

#. [**x**] Specify *refpoint* using *plot* coordinates, i.e., the distances in inches, centimeters, or
   points from the lower left plot origin.  This mechanism is preferred when you wish to lay out
   map features using familiar measurements of distance from origins. An example of such a reference
   point might be **x**\ 2.75i/2c.

#. [**n**] Specify *refpoint* using *normalized* coordinates, i.e., fractional coordinates between 0
   and 1 in both the *x* and *y* directions.  This mechanism avoids units and is useful if you want to always
   place features at locations best referenced as fractions of the plot dimensions.
   An example of such a reference point might be **n**\ 0.2/0.1.

If no code is specified we default to **x**.

With the reference point taken care of, it is time to select the anchor point.
While the reference point selection gives unlimited flexibility to pick
any point inside or outside the map region, the anchor point selection is limited to the nine justification points
discussed for the **j** reference point code above.  Add **+j**\ *anchor* to indicate which justification
point of the map feature should be co-registered with the chosen reference point.  If an anchor point is not
specified then it defaults to the justification point set for the reference point (if **j**\ *code* was
used to set it), or to the mirror opposite of the reference point (if **J**\ *code* was used); with all other
specifications of the reference point, the anchor point takes on the default value of MC (for map rose and
map scale) or BL (all other map features). Adding **+j**\ *anchor* overrules those defaults.
For instance, **+j**\ TR would select the top right point on the map feature as the anchor.

It is likely that you will wish to offset the anchor point away from
your selection by some arbitrary amount, particularly if the reference point is specified with **j**\ \|\ **J**\ *code*.
Do so with  **+o**\ *dx*\ [/*dy*], where *dy* equals *dx* if it is not provided.
These increments are added to the projected plot coordinates of the anchor point, with
positive values moving the reference point in the same direction as the 2-character code of the anchor point implies.
Finally, the adjusted anchor point is matched with the reference point.

Take for example an anchor point on the top left of the map feature, either by using a reference point **j**\ TL, or **J**\ BR,
or explicitly setting **+j**\ TL.
Then **+o**\ 2c/1c will move the anchor point 2 cm left and 1 cm above the top left corner of the map feature.
In other words, the top left corner of the map feature will end up 2 cm to the right and 1 cm below the selected reference point.

Similarly **+j**\ BR will align the bottom right corner of the map feature, and **+o**\ 2c/1c will offset it 2 cm to the left
and 1 cm up. When using middle (M) or center (C) justifications, to offset works the same way as bottom (B) or left (L),
respectively, i.e., moving the map feature up or to the right.


The background panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For most maps you will wish to place a background panel of uniform color behind
any of the map features you plan to add.  Because the panel is linked to the map feature
you have selected, the parameters such as location and dimensions are handled automatically.
What remains is to specify the *attributes* of the panel.  Typically, panels settings are
given via a module's **-F** option by appending one or more modifiers.  Here is a list of
the attributes that are under your control:

#. Color or pattern.  You specify the fill you want with **+g**\ *fill* [Default is no fill].
   For instance, paint the panel yellow with **+g**\ yellow.

#. Panel frame pen.  Turn on the frame outline with **+p**, using the pen defined via
   :ref:`MAP_FRAME_PEN <MAP_FRAME_PEN>`.  You may override this choice with **+p**\ *pen*
   [Default is no outline].  A very bold red outline might look like **+p**\ thick,red.

#. Rounded versus straight rectangle.  By specifying a corner radius with **+r**\ *radius*
   you can round the corners [Default is no rounding]. Here is a 0.2-inch radius rounding:
   **+r**\ 0.2i.

#. Inner frame.  A secondary, inner frame outline may be added as well with the modifier
   **+i**\ [[*gap*/]\ *pen*].  The default pen is given by :ref:`MAP_DEFAULT_PEN <MAP_DEFAULT_PEN>`,
   with a default *gap* between the outer and inner frames of 2 points.  Add arguments to override
   these defaults, such as **+i**\ 0.1c/thin,dashed to get a thin, dashed inner frame offset by
   0.1 cm from the main (outer) frame.

#. Panel clearance.  The panel's dimensions are automatically determined from knowledge of
   its contents.  However, it is sometimes required to add some extra clearance around most or
   all sides, and you can do so with **+c**\ [*clearance*], with a 4-point clearance being
   the default.  Add one (uniform), two (different horizontal and vertical clearances), or
   four (separate for sides west, east, south, and north) clearances, separated by slashes.  For instance, to add
   a 1 cm clearance in x and 5 points in y, use **+c**\ 1c/5p.

#. Drop-down shadow.  Append **+s** to simulate a gray shadow cast toward the southeast.
   You may append [*dx*/*dy*/][*shade*] to change the shade color and the offset of the
   shade [Default is 4p/-4p/gray50].  If happy with the placement but desiring a dark blue
   shadow, add **+s**\ darkblue.

   A map panel is a rectangular background placed behind any of the map features.  It has
   several attributes that can be changed with panel option modifiers.  The light green rounded
   rectangle was specified with **-F+g**\ lightgreen\ **+r**, while the white panel on the
   lower right was set with **-F+p**\ 1p\ **+i+s+g**\ white\ **+c**\ 0.1i (we added a light
   dashed box to indicate the effect of the clearance setting).

Placing map scales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Traditionally, a map scale is added to maps for helping the reader understand the particular scale
used for this map, i.e., it portrays the relationship between actual distances on the Earth
(in km, miles, meters, etc.) and distances on the map (in cm, inches, points).  Depending on
the map projection the map scale will vary continuously but may be constant along a line of
latitude (e.g., Mercator projection).  Thus, in placing the map scale on the map there are
two locations involved: (1) The *reference* point where the map scale's *anchor* should be
pinned, and (2) the *projection* point where the scale is computed and thus where the map
scale is true.  Map scales can be plotted by :doc:`basemap` or :doc:`coast`, and in
addition to the the required *refpoint* and anchor arguments specifying where the scale should be placed there
are both required and optional modifiers.  These are given via these modules' **-L** option.
Here is a list of the attributes that is under your control:

#. Scale bar length.  Required modifier is given with **+w**\ *length*\ [*unit*], where
   *unit* is one of the recognized distance units.  An example might be **+w**\ 250n for
   a bar representing 250 nautical miles at the map scale origin.

#. Map scale origin.  Required modifier given with **+c**\ [*slon*/]\ *slat*, where the longitude
   of the scale origin is optional for projections with constant scale along parallels.  For
   a Mercator projection it may look like **+c**\ 30N while an oblique projection may need **+c**\ 100W/23N,
   for instance.

#. Fancy scale bar.  By default a plain-looking scale bar is plotted.  For a free upgrade to a fancier bar,
   append **+f**.  The fancier bar is, well, a bit fancier.

#. Scale label. Turn on scale labels with **+l**.  By default, the scale label is initialized to
   equal the distance unit name.  Use the **+l**\ *label* argument to supply your own scale label,
   such as **+l**\ "Distances at Equator".

#. Scale label alignment.  The default alignment is on top of the bar [**+at**], but you can change
   this by selecting another alignment by appending them to the **+a** modifier, including
   **b**\ ottom, **l**\ eft, or **r**\ ight.  Here, **+ab** would align on the bottom of the scale.

#. Append distance unit.  For the fancy scale, adding **+u** will append the distance unit specified
   with **+w** to all distance annotations along the bar, while for the plain scale it will replace
   the default scale label with the unit abbreviation.

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_mapscale.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Example of two map scales for a Mercator projection evaluated at 53 degrees north.
   The left-most scale was placed with **-Lj**\ *ML*\ **+c**\ 53\ **+w**\ 1000k\ **+f+l**\ "Scale at 53\\232N"
   while the scale on the right was placed with **-Lj**\ *BR*\ **+c**\ 53\ **+w**\ 1000k\ **+l+f**.

Note that for the purpose of anchor justification (**+j**) the footprint of the map scale is
considered the rectangle that contains the scale and all selected labels and annotations, i.e.,
the map scale's *bounding box*.

.. _Placing-dir-map-roses:

Placing directional map roses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Map roses showing the cardinal directions of a map help the reader orient themselves, especially
for oblique projections where north-south is not vertically aligned.  However, these roses also
have ornamental value and can be used on any map projection.  As for map scales, a directional
map rose is added with :doc:`basemap` or :doc:`coast` and selected by the **-Td** option.
This option accepts the *reference* point where the map rose's *anchor* should be
pinned.  In addition to the required *refpoint* and *anchor* arguments (and their standard
modifiers discussed earlier) there is one required and two optional modifiers. The required
modifier sets the side:

#. Size of map rose.  Use **+w**\ *size* to specify the full width and height of the rose.  A 3 cm
   rose would require **+w**\ 3c.

The next two modifiers are optional:

#. Cardinal points.  By default only the four cardinal points (W, E, S, N) are included in the rose.
   You can extend that with the **+f**\ *level* modifier, where *level* is 1 [Default], 2, or 3.  Selecting
   2 will include the two intermediate orientations NW-SE and NE-SW, while 3 adds the four additional
   orientations WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW, and ENE-WSW.

#. Add labels.  Do so with **+l**,  which places the current one-letter codes for west, east, south,
   and north at the four cardinal points.  These letters depend on the setting of :ref:`GMT_LANGUAGE <GMT_LANGUAGE>`
   and for the default English we use W, E, S, N, respectively.  You can replace these labels with four custom
   labels via  **+l**\ *w,e,s,n*, i.e., four comma-separated labels in the specified order.  You can exclude any
   of the cardinal points from being labeled by giving no label in the corresponding order.  E.g., **+l**",,Down,Up"
   would write Down and Up at the south and north cardinal point, respectively.  Note that for the plain
   directional rose only the north annotation will be placed.

.. _Placing-mag-map-roses:

Placing magnetic map roses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Map roses showing the magnetic directions of a map are useful when magnetic data are presented,
or when declinations are significantly nonzero.  However, as for directional roses the magnetic rose
also has ornamental value.  The magnetic rose consists of two concentric angular scales: The first
(outer) ring shows directional angles while the second (inner) ring is optional and portrays the
magnetic directions, which differ for nonzero declination. As for style, the two-ring rose looks a
bit like a standard compass.  As for directional roses, a magnetic
map rose is added with :doc:`basemap` or :doc:`coast` and selected by the **-Tm** option.
As for other features, append the required *reference* point where the magnetic map rose's *anchor*
should be pinned.  There is one required and several optional modifiers.  First up is the size:

#. Specify size of map rose.  Use **+w**\ *size* to specify the full width of the rose.  A 3 cm
   rose would imply **+w**\ 3c.

The remaining modifiers are optional:

#. Specify Declination.  To add the inner angular scale, append **d**\ *dec*\ [/\ *dlabel*\ ], where
   *dec* is the declination value in decimal or ddd:mm:ss format, and *dlabel* is an optional string
   that replaces the default label (which is "d = *dec*", with d being a Greek delta and we format
   the specified declination).  Append **d**\ *dec*/- to indicate you do not want any declination label.
   As an example, consider **d**\ 11/"Honolulu declination".

#. Draw the secondary (outer) ring outline.  Normally it is not drawn, but you can change that by appending
   **+p**\ *pen*.  For instance, adding **+p**\ thin will draw the ring with the selected thin pen.

#. Add labels.  As for directional roses you do so with **+l**, which places the current one-letter codes for west, east, south,
   and north at the four cardinal points.  These letters depend on the setting of :ref:`GMT_LANGUAGE <GMT_LANGUAGE>`
   and for the default English we use W, E, S, N, respectively.  You can replace these labels with four custom
   labels via  **+l**\ *w,e,s,n*, i.e., four comma-separated labels in the specified order.  You can exclude any
   of the cardinal points from being labeled by giving no label in the corresponding order.  E.g., **+l**",,Down,Up"
   would write Down and Up at the south and north cardinal point, respectively.

#. Draw the primary (inner) ring outline.  It is also not normally drawn; change that by appending
   **+i**\ *pen*.  For instance, adding **+i**\ thin,blue will draw the ring with the selected thin, blue pen.

#. Set annotation, tick and grid intervals.  Each ring has a default annotation [30], tick [5], and grid [1]
   interval (although here "grid interval" is just a finer tick interval drawn at half tickmark length).
   Adjust these three intervals with **+t**\ *intervals*.  If you selected **+d** then you must supply
   two sets of such intervals (i.e., 6 comma-separated values), where the first (primary) set refers to
   the declination-adjusted ring and the second (secondary) set refers to the directional (outer) ring.
   If only three intervals are given then we assume you want the same intervals for both rings.  As an example,
   to annotate every 90 degrees and tick every 15 and 5 degrees, add **+t**\ 90/15/5.

   Magnetic direction map rose. This symbol is quite complicated and has many items whose attributes are
   in part controlled by GMT defaults parameters and in part by the above modifiers.  The color-coded legend
   indicates which parameters controls the font, pen, or color of the correspond item of the rose.  This rose
   was specified by **-Tmg**\ -2/0.5\ **+w**\ 2.5i\ **+d**\ -14.5\ **+t**\ 45/10/5\ **+i**\ 0.25p,blue\ **+p**\ 0.25p,red\ **+l+j**\ CM.
   See :doc:`gmt.conf` for more details on the default parameters.

Placing color scale bars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Color scale bars are used in conjunction with color-coded surfaces, symbols, lines, or even text, to
relate the chosen color to a data value or category.  For instance, color images of topography
or other gridded data will need a mechanism for users to decode what the colors represent.  Typically, we do this
by adding a color scale bar on the outside (or inside) of the map boundaries.  The module
:doc:`colorbar` places the color scale bar, with location and size determined by the **-D** attributes.
As for other map features we must specify the reference and anchor points and any adjustments to them, then
supply suitable required and optional modifiers:

#. Give dimensions of color bar.  Use **+w**\ *length*/*width* to specify the full width and height of the bar.
   For instance, a 10 cm long bar of height 0.5 cm would imply **+w**\ 10c/0.5c.

#. Set orientation of color bar.  By default, we place a vertically aligned bar.  Select a horizontal bar by
   adding **+h**.

#. Specify color bar label alignment.  By default we place the chosen annotations, scale (i.e., x-axis) label
   and unit (i.e., y-axis) label on the opposite side of the color scale bar anchor point.  Change this
   with **+m** and append any combination of **a**, **l**, or **u** to flip the annotations or labels
   to the opposite side.  Append **c** to plot vertical labels as column text (this cannot be used with
   **+h**, obviously).

#. Extend the color bar.  You can use the **+e** modifier to add sidebar triangles for displaying the
   current back- and foreground colors.  Append **b** (background) or **f** (foreground) to get the implied side
   only [Default is both].  Optionally, append triangle height [Default is half the bar *width*].

#. Add missing data key.  Append **+n** to draw a rectangle with the current NaN color and label it NaN.
   Optionally, append a replacement *text*.  One example might be **+n**\ "No data".

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_colorbar.*

   :align: center

   Color bar placed beneath a map (here truncated).  We extended the bar to show background and foreground
   colors, and used the frame-annotation machinery to add labels.  The bar was placed with
   **-D**\ *JBC*\ **+o**\ 0/0.35i\ **+w**\ 4.5i/0.1i\ **+h**.

Placing map legends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding map legends is the standard way to communicate what various symbols placed on your map
represent.  For instance, you may use this mechanism to convey the information that circles are
earthquake locations, triangles are places where you ate Thai food, and dashed lines indicate
some sort of gang-land demarkation line that you should not cross without paying the locals due respect.
Map legends are placed by the module :doc:`legend`, with location and size determined by the
various **-D** attributes. We must again specify the reference and anchor points and any adjustments to them
first, then supply suitable required and optional modifiers:

#. Give legend dimensions.  You must specify the required legend width, while legend height is optional
   and if not given is computed based on the contents of the legend.  The syntax is therefore
   **+w**\ *width*\ [/*height*] in your desired plot units.  Thus, **+w**\ 12c sets the legend width
   as 12 cm but the hight will become whatever is needed to contain the information.

#. Set line-spacing.  You may optionally specify the line-spacing used for the setting of the legend.  The legend will
   typically consist of several lines that may or may not contain text, but the spacing between
   these lines are controlled by the chosen line-spacing factor times the current primary annotation
   font setting, i.e., :ref:`FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY <FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY>`.  The default line spacing factor
   is 1.1; change this with **+l**\ *linefactor*.

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_legend.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Example of a map legend placed with :doc:`legend`.  Apart from the placement and dimensions discussed
   here, :doc:`legend` reads macro commands that specifies each item of the legend, including colors,
   widths of columns, the number of columns, and presents a broad selection of items.  Here, we
   simply used **-Dx**\ 0/0\ **+w**\ 5.6i\ **+j**\ *BL*.

Placing raster and EPS images on maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When preparing posters for meetings one will often need to include the organization's logo,
which may be available to you as an Encapsulated PostScript File (EPS) or as a raster image,
such as PNG or JPG.  At other times, you may wish to place photos or other raster images on
your map.  The module :doc:`image` can help with this, and like the other map feature
placements it requires a reference point and its optional adjustments via the **-D** option.
In addition, we require one (of two) modifiers to determine the image size.

#. Specify image width.  This is a required modifier and is set via **+w**\ *width*\ [/*height*].
   If *height* is specified as 0 then we compute the height from *width* and the aspect
   ratio of the image, for instance **+w**\ 4c/0.  If *width* is negative the we use its absolute value as width
   but interpolate the image in PostScript to the device resolution.

#. Specify image resolution.  For raster images (not EPS) you may instead specify the size of the
   plotted image by specifying its resolution in dots per inch, via **+r**\ *dpi*.  The
   actual size of the images is then controlled by its number of pixels times the *dpi*.

#. Enable image replication.  For raster images (not EPS) you may optionally append **+n**\ *nx*\ [/*ny*]
   to indicate that you want the source image to be replicated that many times in the two
   directions, resulting in a tiling of the map using the selected image.  This may be useful
   in conjunction with an active clip path set by :doc:`clip`.

Placing a GMT logo on maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to overlay the GMT logo on maps as well, using the module :doc:`gmtlogo`.
Like other features it requires reference and anchor points and their optional adjustments via the **-D** option.
In addition, we require one modifier to set the logo's size.

#. Specify logo width.  This is a required modifier and is set via **+w**\ *width*.
   The height is automatically set (it is half the width).  To place a 5 cm wide
   GMT logo, append **+w**\ 5c.

   Placement of the GMT logo. The logo itself only has a size modifier but the :doc:`gmtlogo`
   module allows additional attributes such as a background map panel.

Placing map insets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our penultimate map embellishment is the map inset.
A map inset may appear to be the easiest feature to add since it only consists of an empty map panel.
What you put in this panel is up to you (and we will show some examples).  However, unlike
the other map features there are two ways to specify the placement of the map inset.
The first is the standard way of specifying the reference and anchor points and the inset dimensions,
while the second specifies a *subregion* in the current plot that should be designated the
map inset area.  Depending on the map projection this may or may not be a rectangular area.
Map insets are produced by the module :doc:`basemap` via the **-D** option. Unless you
use the reference point approach you must first append *xmin*/*xmax*/*ymin*/*ymax*\ [**+r**][**+u**\ *unit*\ ],
where the optional *unit* modifier **+u** indicates that the four coordinates to follow are projected
distances (e.g., km, miles).  If the unit modifier is missing then we assume the coordinates are
map coordinates (e.g., geographic *west*, *east*, *south*, and *north*).  For oblique
projections you may wish to specify the domain using the lower-left and upper-right coordinates
instead (similar to how the **-R** option works), by adding **+r**\ .  Some optional modifiers are available:

#. Set inset size.  If you specified a reference point then you must also specify the inset dimensions with the
   **+w**\ *width*\ [*unit*][/*height*\ [*unit*]], where *height* defaults to *width* if not given.
   Append the unit of the dimensions, which may be distance units such as km, feet, etc., and
   the map projection will be used to determine inset dimensions on the map.  For instance,
   **+w**\ 300k/200k is a 300x200 km region (which depends on the projection) while **+w**\ 5c
   is a 5cm square box.

#. Save the location and dimensions.  For all but the simplest of map insets you will need to
   know the exact location of the resulting inset and its dimensions.  For instance, if you
   specified the inset using the TR anchor point and a width and height of 100 km you will need to
   know what this means in terms of positions on the map in plot units.  In terms of the modifiers
   this would be **j**\ TR\ **+w**\ 100k.  Running :doc:`basemap`
   in verbose mode will provide this information and you can use it accordingly.  However, for
   users who wish to script this automatically you can use **+s**\ *file* to save this information
   in a file that your script can ingest and act upon.  The file contains a single record with the
   four tab-separated values *x0 y0 width height* in the current plot units [cm], where *x0 y0* refers
   to the lower-left point on the inset.  See the figure caption for an example.

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_inset.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Demonstration of how a map inset may be used to place a global overview map as an inset in a
   regional map.  Main map shows the regional area of Australia.  We place an inset in the upper
   right area with **-Dj**\ TR\ **+w**\ 1.5i\ **+o**\ 0.15i\ **+s**\ tmp and then read in the coordinates
   of the lower-right corner of the inset and its dimension with UNIX ("read x0 y0 w h < tmp").
   Knowing the placement (we know the size of the circular global map) we can correctly position it
   in the inset with **-X$x0** and **-Y$y0**.
   See Example :ref:`example_44` for more details.

Placing a vertical scale on maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our final embellishment is reserved for wiggles plotted along track with :doc:`wiggle` and
is activated as an option within that module.
Like other features, it requires reference and anchor points and their optional adjustments via the **-D** option.
In addition, we offer a few modifier to set the scale bar's remaining attributes:

#. Specify vertical scale bar length.  This is a required modifier and is set via **+l**\ *length*.
   The length is given in the data (*z*) units of your plot.  To indicate that your vertical scale bar
   should reflect 100 nTesla, append **+l**\ 100.  The actual dimension of the scale bar on your map
   depends on the data scale set in :doc:`wiggle` via **-Z**.

#. Place the label on the left side of the vertical scale bar.  This is an optional modifier and is set via **+m**.
   By default, the scale bar has open ``teeth`` pointing right and a label on that side. The **m** moves the
   label to the left and reverses the teeth direction as well.

#. Add a unit to the vertical scale bar label.  This is an optional modifier and is set via **+u**\ *unit*.
   To append nT (nTesla) to the label you would specify **+u**\ nT.

Grid file format specifications
-------------------------------

GMT has the ability to read and write grids using more than one grid file format
(see Table :ref:`grdformats <tbl-grdformats>` for supported format and their IDs).
For reading, GMT will automatically determine the format of grid files, while for
writing you will normally have to append *=ID* to the filename if you want GMT to
use a different format than the default. The automatic reading procedure follows an heuristic
where certain formats are tentatively decoded with GMT internal drivers and if they fail than
we resort to use the GDAL library to do the readings. This normally works pretty well but in case
of failure (e.g. a GMT driver failed to read binary file with a separate header that also could
have been stored in an ASCII file with embed header) the user should explicitly try to force a
reading via GDAL. That is, to append a *=gd* suffix to file name.

By default, GMT will create new grid files using the **nf** format;
however, this behavior can be overridden by setting the
:ref:`IO_GRIDFILE_FORMAT <IO_GRIDFILE_FORMAT>` defaults parameter to any of the other
recognized values (or by appending *=ID*).

GMT can also read netCDF grid files produced by other software
packages, provided the grid files satisfy the COARDS and Hadley Centre
conventions for netCDF grids. Thus, products created under those
conventions (provided the grid is 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-dimensional) can be
read directly by GMT and the netCDF grids written by GMT can be read
by other programs that conform to those conventions. Three such programs are
`ncview <http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html>`_, `Panoply
<http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/>`_, and `ncBrowse
<http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/ncBrowse/>`_ ; others can be found on the
`netCDF website <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/software.html>`_.
Note that although many additional programs can read netCDF files, some are unable
to read netcdf 4 files (if data compression has been applied).

In addition, users with some C-programming experience may add their own
read/write functions and link them with the GMT library to extend the
number of predefined formats. Technical information on this topic can be
found in the source file ``gmt_customio.c``. Users who are considering this approach
should contact the GMT team.

Because some formats have limitations on the range of values they can
store it is sometimes necessary to provide more than simply the name of
the file and its ID on the command line. For instance, a native short
integer file may use a unique value to signify an empty node or NaN, and
the data may need translation and scaling prior to use. Therefore, all
GMT programs that read or write grid files will decode the given
filename as follows:

name[=\ *ID*\ ][**+s**\ *scale*][**+o**\ *offset*][**+n**\ *invalid*]

where anything in brackets is optional. If you are reading a grid then
no options are needed: just continue to pass the name of the grid file.
However, if you write another format you must append the =\ *ID* string,
where *ID* is the format code listed above. In addition, should you want
to (1) multiply the data by a scale factor, and (2) add a constant
offset you must append the **+s**\ *scale* and **+o**\ *offset* modifiers. Finally, if you
need to indicate that a certain data value should be interpreted as a
NaN (not-a-number) you must append **+n**\ *invalid* modifier to file name.
You may the scale as *a* for auto-adjusting the scale and/or offset of
packed integer grids (=\ *ID*\ **+s**\ *a* is a shorthand for
=\ *ID*\ **+s**\ *a*\ **+o**\ *a*).

Note that the GMT netCDF and native binary grids store the grid scale and offset
in the file, hence if you specify these attributes when writing a file then upon reading the grid
these settings will automatically take effect.  You can override them by supplying different scales
and offsets, of course.  For the  grid formats that do not store these attributes
you will need to supply them both when reading and writing.

Some of the grid formats allow writing to standard output and reading
from standard input which means you can connect GMT programs that
operate on grid files with pipes, thereby speeding up execution and
eliminating the need for large, intermediate grid files. You specify
standard input/output by leaving out the filename entirely. That means
the "filename" will begin with "=\ *ID*". Note that the netCDF format
does not allow piping.

Everything looks clearer after a few examples:

*  To write a native binary float grid file, specify the name as ``my_file.f4=bf`` .

*  To read a native short integer grid file, multiply the data by 10 and
   then add 32000, but first let values that equal 32767 be set to NaN,
   use the filename ``my_file.i2=bs+s10+o32000+n32767``.

*  To read a Golden Software "surfer" format 6 grid file, just pass the
   file name, e.g., ``my_surferfile.grd``.

*  To read a 8-bit standard Sun raster file (with values in the 0--255
   range) and convert it to a 1 range, give the name as ``rasterfile+s7.84313725e-3+o-1``
   (i.e., 1/127.5).

*  To write a native binary short integer grid file to standard output
   after subtracting 32000 and dividing its values by 10, give filename
   as ``=bs+s0.1+o-3200``.

*  To write an 8-bit integer netCDF grid file with an auto-adjusted
   offset, give filename as ``=nb+oa``.

*  To read a short integer *.bil* grid file stored in binary and and force
   the reading via GDAL, add suffix *=gd* as in ``n45_e008_1arc_v3.bil=gd``

Programs that both read and/or write more than one grid file may specify
different formats and/or scaling for the files involved. The only
restriction with the embedded grid specification mechanism is that no
grid files may actually use the "=" character as part of their name
(presumably, a small sacrifice).

One can also define special file suffixes to imply a specific file
format; this approach represents a more intuitive and user-friendly way
to specify the various file formats. The user may create a file called
``gmt.io`` in the current directory or home directory, or in the directory
``~/.gmt`` and define any number of custom formats. The following is an example of
a ``gmt.io`` file:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| # GMT i/o shorthand file                                                  |

| # It can have any number of comment lines like this one anywhere          |
| # suffix format_id scale offset NaN Comments                              |

+-------+-----+-----+---+-------+-------------------------------------------+
| bit   | bm  | \-  | \-| \-    | Native binary 0 or 1 grids                |
+-------+-----+-----+---+-------+-------------------------------------------+
| mask  | bm  | \-  | \-| 0     | Native binary 1 or NaN masks              |
+-------+-----+-----+---+-------+-------------------------------------------+
| faa   | bs  | 0.1 | \-| 32767 | Native binary gravity in 0.1 mGal         |

|       |     |     |   |       | auto-scale and auto-offset                |
+-------+-----+-----+---+-------+-------------------------------------------+

These suffices can be anything that makes sense to the user. To activate
this mechanism, set parameter :ref:`IO_GRIDFILE_SHORTHAND <IO_GRIDFILE_SHORTHAND>` to TRUE in
your :doc:`gmt.conf` file. Then, using the filename ``stuff.i2`` is equivalent to saying ``stuff.i2=bs+n32767``, and the
filename ``wet.mask`` means wet.mask=bm+n0. For a file intended for masking, i.e.,
the nodes are either 1 or NaN, the bit or mask format file may be as
small as 1/32 the size of the corresponding grid float format file.

Modifiers for changing units of grid coordinates
------------------------------------------------

A few GMT tools require that the two horizontal dimensions be
specified in meters. One example is
:doc:`grdfft` which must compute the 2-D
Fourier transform of a grid and evaluate wave numbers in the proper units
(1/meter). There are two situations where the user may need to change
the coordinates of the grid passed to such programs:

-  You have a geographic grid (i.e., in longitude and latitude). Simply
   supply the **-fg** option and your grid coordinates will
   automatically be converted to meters via a "Flat Earth" approximation
   on the currently selected ellipsoid (Note: this is only possible in
   those few programs that require this capability. In general, **-fg**
   is used to specify table coordinates).

-  You have a Cartesian grid but the units are not meters (e.g., they
   may perhaps be in km or miles). In this case you may append the file
   modifier **+u**\ *unit*, where *unit* is one of non-angular units listed
   in Table :ref:`distunits <tbl-distunits>`. For example, reading in the grid (which has
   distance units of km) and converting distances to meters is done by
   specifying the filename as *filename*\ **+u**\ k. On output, any derived grids will revert
   to their original units *unless* you specify another unit modifier to
   the output grid. This may be used, for instance, to save the original
   grid with distances in meters using some other unit.

For convenience, we also support the inverse translation, i.e.,
**+U**\ *unit*. This modifier can be used to convert your grid
coordinates *from* meters *to* the specified unit. Example :ref:`example_28` shows a
case where this is being used to change an UTM grid in meters to km.
These modifiers are only allowed when map projections are not selected
(or are Cartesian).

.. _modifiers-for-CF:

Modifiers for COARDS-compliant netCDF files
-------------------------------------------

When the netCDF grid file contains more than one 2-dimensional variable,
GMT programs will load the first such variable in the file and ignore
all others. Alternatively, the user can select the required variable by
adding the suffix "?\ *varname*" to the grid file name. For example, to
get information on the variable "slp" in file , use:

   ::

    gmt grdinfo "file.nc?slp"

Since COARDS-compliant netCDF files are the default, the additional
suffix "=nf" can be omitted.

If there are no 2-dimensional variables and no specific variable was
selected, we default to the first higher-dimensional matrix and select
the first layer.

In case the named grid is 3-dimensional, GMT will load the first
(bottom) layer. If another layer is required, either add "[*index*]"
or "(*level*)", where *index* is the index of the third (depth) variable
(starting at 0 for the first layer) and *level* is the numerical value
of the third (depth) variable associated with the requested layer. To
indicate the second layer of the 3-D variable "slp" use as file name: ``file.nc?slp[1]``.

When you supply the numerical value for the third variable using
"(*level*)", GMT will pick the layer closest to that value. No
interpolation is performed.

Note that the question mark, brackets and parentheses have special
meanings on Unix-based platforms. Therefore, you will need to either
*escape* these characters, by placing a backslash in front of them, or
place the whole file name plus modifiers between single quotes or double
quotes.

A similar approach is followed for loading 4-dimensional grids. Consider
a 4-dimensional grid with the following variables:

   ::

    lat(lat): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    lon(lon): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    depth(depth): 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90
    time(time): 0, 12, 24, 36, 48
    pressure(time,depth,lat,lon): (5000 values)

To get information on the 10x10 grid of pressure at
depth 10 and at time 24, one would use:

   ::

    gmt grdinfo "file.nc?pressure[2,1]"

or (only in case the coordinates increase linearly):

   ::

    gmt grdinfo "file.nc?pressure(24,10)"

Programs that generally deal with columns of one-dimensional data, like
or can use multi-dimensional netCDF files in a very similar way. If a
variable in a netCDF file is one-dimensional, there is nothing more
needed than name the variables on the command line. For example:

   ::

    gmt plot "file.nc?lon/lat" ...
    gmt convert "file.nc?time/lat/lon"

If one or more of the selected variables are two-dimensional, and have
the same leading dimension as the other selected variables they will be
plotted in their entirety. For example, if a netCDF files contains 6
time steps recording temperature at 4 points, and the variable ``temp`` is a 6 by
4 array, then the command ``gmt convert "file.nc?time/temp"`` can result in:

   ::

    2012-06-25T00:00:00 20.1 20.2 20.1 20.3
    2012-06-25T12:00:00 24.2 23.2 24.5 23.5
    2012-06-26T00:00:00 16.1 16.2 16.1 16.3
    2012-06-26T12:00:00 22.1 23.0 23.9 23.5
    2012-06-27T00:00:00 17.5 16.9 17.2 16.8
    2012-06-27T12:00:00 27.2 27.2 27.5 27.5

If, for example, only the second temperature column is needed, use
``gmt convert "file.nc?time/temp[1]"`` (indices start counting at 0).

The COARDS conventions set restrictions on the names that can be used
for the units of the variables and coordinates. For example, the units
of longitude and latitude are "degrees_east" and "degrees_north",
respectively. Here is an example of the header of a COARDS compliant
netCDF file (to be obtained using **ncdump**):

   ::

    netcdf M2_fes2004 {
    dimensions:
            lon = 2881 ;
            lat = 1441 ;
    variables:
            float lon(lon) ;
                    lon:long_name = "longitude" ;
                    lon:units = "degrees_east" ;
                    lon:actual_range = 0., 360. ;
            float lat(lat) ;
                    lat:long_name = "latitude" ;
                    lat:units = "degrees_north" ;
                    lat:actual_range = -90., 90. ;
            short amp(lat, lon) ;
                    amp:long_name = "amplitude" ;
                    amp:unit = "m" ;
                    amp:scale_factor = 0.0001 ;
                    amp:add_offset = 3. ;
                    amp:_FillValue = -32768s ;
            short pha(lat, lon) ;
                    pha:long_name = "phase" ;
                    pha:unit = "degrees" ;
                    pha:scale_factor = 0.01 ;
                    pha:_FillValue = -32768s ;

This file contains two grids, which can be plotted separately using the
names ``M2_fes2004.nc?amp`` and ``M2_fes2004.nc?pha``. The attributes ``long_name`` and ``unit`` for each variable
are combined in GMT to a single unit string. For example, after
reading the grid ``y_unit`` equals ``latitude [degrees_north]``. The
same method can be used in reverse to set the proper variable names and
units when writing a grid. However, when the coordinates are set
properly as geographical or time axes, GMT will take care of this. The
user is, however, still responsible for setting the variable name and
unit of the z-coordinate. The default is simply "z".

Modifiers to read and write grids and images via GDAL
-----------------------------------------------------

If the support has been configured during installation, then GMT can
read and write a variety of grid and image formats via GDAL. This
extends the capability of GMT to handle data sets from a variety of
sources.

Reading multi-band images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`grdimage` and :doc:`image` both lets the user select
individual bands in a multi-band image file and treats the result as an
image (that is the values, in the 0--255 range, are treated as colors,
not data). To select individual bands you use the **+b**\ *band-number*
mechanism that must be appended to the image filename. Here,
*band-number* can be the number of one individual band (the counting
starts at zero), or it could be a comma-separated list of bands. For example

   ::

    gmt image jpeg_image_with_three_bands.jpg+b0

will plot only the first band (i.e., the red band) of the jpeg image as
a gray-scale image, and

   ::

    gmt image jpeg_image_with_three_bands.jpg+b2,1,0

will plot the same image in color but where the RGB band order has been reversed.

Instead of treating them as images, all other GMT programs that
process grids can read individual bands from an image but will consider
the values to be regular data. For example, let ``multiband`` be the name of a
multi-band file with a near infrared component in band 4 and red in band
3. We will compute the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index),
which is defined as NDVI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R), as

   ::

    gmt grdmath multiband=gd+b3 multiband=gd+b2 SUB multiband=gd+b3 \
                multiband=gd+b2 ADD DIV = ndvi.nc

The resulting grid ``ndvi.nc`` can then be plotted as usual.

Reading more complex multi-band IMAGES or GRIDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to access to sub-datasets in a multi-band grid. The
next example shows how we can extract the SST from the MODIS file ``A20030012003365.L3m_YR_NSST_9``
that is stored in the HDF "format". We need to run the GDAL program
**gdalinfo** on the file because we first
must extract the necessary metadata from the file:

.. code-block:: none

    gdalinfo A20030012003365.L3m_YR_NSST_9

     Scaled Data Maximum=45
     Data Minimum=-1.999999
     Data Maximum=34.76
    Subdatasets:
     SUBDATASET_1_NAME=HDF4_SDS:UNKNOWN:"A20030012003365.L3m_YR_NSST_9":0
     SUBDATASET_1_DESC=[2160x4320] l3m_data (16-bit unsigned integer)
     SUBDATASET_2_NAME=HDF4_SDS:UNKNOWN:"A20030012003365.L3m_YR_NSST_9":1
     SUBDATASET_2_DESC=[2160x4320] l3m_qual (8-bit unsigned integer)

Now, to access this file with GMT we need to use the =gd mechanism and
append the name of the sub-dataset that we want to extract. Here, a
simple example using :doc:`grdinfo` would be

   ::

    gmt grdinfo A20030012003365.L3m_YR_NSST_9=gd?HDF4_SDS:UNKNOWN:"A20030012003365.L3m_YR_NSST_9:0"

    HDF4_SDS:UNKNOWN:A20030012003365.L3m_YR_NSST_9:0: scale_factor: 1 add_offset: 0

Be warned, however, that things are not yet completed because while the
data are scaled according to the equation printed above ("Scaling
Equation=(Slope\*l3m_data) + Intercept = Parameter value"), this
scaling is not applied by GDAL on reading so it cannot be done
automatically by GMT. One solution is to do the reading and scaling
via :doc:`grdmath` first, i.e.,

   ::

    gmt grdmath A20030012003365.L3m_YR_NSST_9=gd?HDF4_SDS:UNKNOWN:"A20030012003365.L3m_YR_NSST_9:0" \
                0.000717185 MUL -2 ADD = sst.nc

then plot the ``sst.nc`` directly.

.. _Write-grids-images:

Writing grids and images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Saving images in the common raster formats is possible but, for the time being, only from :doc:`grdimage` and even
that is restricted to raster type information. That is, vector data (for instance, coast lines) or text will not
be saved. To save an image with :doc:`grdimage` use the **-A**\ *outimg=driver* mechanism, where *driver*
is the driver code name used by GDAL (e.g. GTiff).

For all other programs that create grids, it is also possible to save them using GDAL. To do it one need to use
the =gd appended with the necessary information regarding the driver and the data type to use. Generically,
=\ **gd**\ [**+s**\ *scale*][**+o**\ *offset*][**+n**\ *nan*][:<*driver*\ >[/\ *dataType*][**+c**\ *options*]]
where *driver* is the same as explained above and *dataType* is a 2 or 3 chars code from:
u8\|u16\|i16\|u32\|i32\|float32, and where i\|u denotes signed\|unsigned. If not provided the default type
is float32. Both driver names and data types are case insensitive. The *options* is a list of one or more concatenated
number of GDAL *-co* options. For example, to write a lossless JPG2000 grid one would append
**+c**\ QUALITY=100\ **+c**\ REVERSIBLE=YES\ **+c**\ YCBCR420=NO
Note: you will have to specify a *nan* value for integer data types unless you wish that all NaN data values
should be replaced by zero.

The NaN data value
------------------

For a variety of data processing and plotting tasks there is a need to
acknowledge that a data point is missing or unassigned. In the "old
days", such information was passed by letting a value like -9999.99 take
on the special meaning of "this is not really a value, it is missing".
The problem with this scheme is that -9999.99 (or any other floating
point value) may be a perfectly reasonable data value and in such a
scenario would be skipped. The solution adopted in GMT is to use the
IEEE concept Not-a-Number (NaN) for this purpose. Mathematically, a NaN
is what you get if you do an undefined mathematical operation like
0/0; in ASCII data files they appear as the textstring NaN. This
value is internally stored with a particular bit pattern defined by IEEE
so that special action can be taken when it is encountered by programs.
In particular, a standard library function called ``isnan`` is used to
test if a floating point is a NaN. GMT uses these tests extensively to
determine if a value is suitable for plotting or processing (if a NaN is
used in a calculation the result would become NaN as well). Data points
whose values equal NaN are not normally plotted (or plotted with the
special NaN color given in :doc:`gmt.conf`). Several tools such as
:doc:`xyz2grd`, :doc:`gmtmath`, and
:doc:`grdmath` can convert user data to NaN
and vice versa, thus facilitating arbitrary masking and clipping of data
sets. Note that a few computers do not have native IEEE hardware
support. At this point, this applies to some of the older Cray
super-computers. Users on such machines may have to adopt the old
'-9999.99' scheme to achieve the desired results.

Data records that contain NaN values for the *x* or *y* columns (or the
*z* column for cases when 3-D Cartesian data are expected) are usually
skipped during reading. However, the presence of these bad records can
be interpreted in two different ways, and this behavior is controlled by
the :ref:`IO_NAN_RECORDS <IO_NAN_RECORDS>` defaults parameter. The default setting (*gap*)
considers such records to indicate a gap in an otherwise continuous
series of points (e.g., a line), and programs can act upon this
information, e.g., not to draw a line across the gap or to break the
line into separate segments. The alternative setting (*bad*) makes no
such interpretation and simply reports back how many bad records were
skipped during reading; see Section `Data gap detection: The -g option`_ for details.

.. _Directory parameters:

Directory parameters
--------------------

GMT versions prior to GMT 5 relied solely on several environment variables
($GMT_SHAREDIR, $GMT_DATADIR, $GMT_USERDIR, and $GMT_TMPDIR), pointing
to folders with data files and program settings. Beginning with version
5, some of these locations are now (also or exclusively) configurable
with the :doc:`gmtset` utility.
When an environment variable has an equivalent parameter in the :doc:`gmt.conf` file,
then the parameter setting will take precedence over the environment variable.

Variable $GMT_SHAREDIR
    was sometimes required in previous GMT versions to locate the GMT
    share directory where all run-time support files such as coastlines,
    custom symbols, PostScript macros, color tables, and much more reside.
    If this parameter is not set (default), GMT will make a reasonable
    guess of the location of its share folder. Setting this variable is
    usually not required and recommended only under special circumstances.

Variable $GMT_DATADIR and parameter DIR_DATA
    may point to one or more directories where large and/or widely used
    data files can be placed. All GMT programs look in these directories
    when a file is specified on the command line and it is not present in
    the current directory. This allows maintainers to consolidate large
    data files and to simplify scripting that use these files since the
    absolute path need not be specified. Separate multiple directories
    with colons (:) -- under Windows use semi-colons (;). Any directory
    name that ends in a trailing slash (/) will be searched recursively
    (not under Windows).

Variable $GMT_USERDIR
    may point to a directory where the user places custom configuration
    files (e.g., an alternate ``coastline.conf`` file, preferred default
    settings in ``gmt.conf``, custom symbols and color palettes, math
    macros for :doc:`gmtmath` and :doc:`grdmath`, and shorthands for
    gridfile extensions via ``gmt.io``). When $GMT_USERDIR is not defined,
    then the default value $HOME/.gmt will be assumed. Users may also place their own
    data files in this directory as GMT programs will search for files
    given on the command line in both DIR_DATA and $GMT_USERDIR.

Variable $GMT_CACHEDIR
    may point to a directory where the user places cached data files
    downloaded from the GMT data server. When $GMT_CACHEDIR is not defined,
    then the default value $HOME/.gmt/cache will be assumed. The cache
    directory can be emptied by running gmt **gmt clear cache**.

Variable $GMT_TMPDIR
    may indicate the location, where GMT will write its state parameters
    via the two files ``gmt.history`` and ``gmt.conf``. If $GMT_TMPDIR is not
    set, these files are written to the current directory. See Section
    `Isolation mode`_ for more information.

Parameter DIR_DCW
    specifies where to look for the optional Digital Charts of the World
    database (for country coloring or selections).

Parameter DIR_GSHHG
    specifies where to look for the required
    Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography database.


Note that files whose full path is given will never be searched for in
any of these directories.


GMT Coordinate Transformations
==============================

GMT programs read real-world coordinates and convert them to positions
on a plot. This is achieved by selecting one of several coordinate
transformations or projections. We distinguish between three sets of
such conversions:

-  Cartesian coordinate transformations

-  Polar coordinate transformations

-  Map coordinate transformations

The next Chapter will be dedicated to GMT map projections in its
entirety. Meanwhile, the present Chapter will summarize the properties
of the Cartesian and Polar coordinate transformations available in
GMT, list which parameters define them, and demonstrate how they are
used to create simple plot axes. We will mostly be using
:doc:`basemap` (and occasionally :doc:`plot`) to demonstrate the various
transformations. Our illustrations may differ from those you reproduce
with the same commands because of different settings in our ``gmt.conf`` file.)
Finally, note that while we will specify dimensions in inches (by
appending **i**), you may want to use cm (**c**), or points (**p**) as
unit instead (see the :doc:`gmt.conf` man page).

Cartesian transformations
-------------------------

GMT Cartesian coordinate transformations come in three flavors:

-  Linear coordinate transformation

-  Log\ :math:`_{10}` coordinate transformation

-  Power (exponential) coordinate transformation

These transformations convert input coordinates *(x,y)* to
locations *(x', y')* on a plot. There is no coupling between
*x* and *y* (i.e., *x' = f(x)* and *y' = f(y)*);
it is a **one-dimensional** projection. Hence, we may use separate
transformations for the *x*- and *y*-axes (and
*z*-axes for 3-D plots). Below, we will use the expression
*u' = f(u)*, where *u* is either *x* or *y* (or
*z* for 3-D plots). The coefficients in *f(u)* depend on the
desired plot size (or scale), the chosen *(x,y)* domain, and the
nature of *f* itself.

Two subsets of linear will be discussed separately; these are a polar
(cylindrical) projection and a linear projection applied to geographic
coordinates (with a 360º periodicity in the *x*-coordinate). We
will show examples of all of these projections using dummy data sets
created with :doc:`gmtmath`, a "Reverse
Polish Notation" (RPN) calculator that operates on or creates table data:

   ::

      gmt math -T0/100/1  T SQRT = sqrt.txt
      gmt math -T0/100/10 T SQRT = sqrt10.txt

Cartesian linear transformation (**-Jx** **-JX**)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are in fact three different uses of the Cartesian linear
transformation, each associated with specific command line options. The
different manifestations result from specific properties of three kinds
of data:

#. Regular floating point coordinates

#. Geographic coordinates

#. Calendar time coordinates

   Examples of Cartesian (left), circular (middle), and geo-vectors (right) for different
   attribute specifications. Note that both full and half arrow-heads can be specified, as well as no head at all.

Regular floating point coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Selection of the Cartesian linear transformation with regular floating
point coordinates will result in a simple linear scaling
*u' = au + b* of the input coordinates. The projection is defined
by stating scale in inches/unit (**-Jx**) or axis length in inches (**-JX**).
If the *y*-scale or *y*-axis length is different from that of the
*x*-axis (which is most often the case), separate the two scales (or
lengths) by a slash, e.g., **-Jx**\ 0.1i/0.5i or **-JX**\ 8i/5i. Thus,
our :math:`y = \sqrt{x}` data sets will plot as shown in
Figure :ref:`Linear transformation of Cartesian coordinates <GMT_linear>`.

.. _GMT_linear:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_linear.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Linear transformation of Cartesian coordinates.


The complete commands given to produce this plot were

   ::

    gmt plot -R0/100/0/10 -JX3i/1.5i -Bag -BWSne+gsnow -Wthick,blue,- -P -K sqrt.txt > GMT_linear.ps
    gmt plot -R -J -St0.1i -N -Gred -Wfaint -O sqrt10.txt >> GMT_linear.ps

Normally, the user's *x*-values will increase to the right and the
*y*-values will increase upwards. It should be noted that in many
situations it is desirable to have the direction of positive coordinates
be reversed. For example, when plotting depth on the *y*-axis it makes
more sense to have the positive direction downwards. All that is
required to reverse the sense of positive direction is to supply a
negative scale (or axis length). Finally, sometimes it is convenient to
specify the width (or height) of a map and let the other dimension be
computed based on the implied scale and the range of the other axis. To
do this, simply specify the length to be recomputed as 0.

Geographic coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _GMT_linear_d:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_linear_d.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Linear transformation of map coordinates.


While the Cartesian linear projection is primarily designed for regular
floating point *x*,\ *y* data, it is sometimes necessary to plot
geographical data in a linear projection. This poses a problem since
longitudes have a 360º periodicity. GMT therefore needs to be informed
that it has been given geographical coordinates even though a linear
transformation has been chosen. We do so by adding a **g** (for
geographical) or **d** (for degrees) directly after **-R** or by
appending a **g** or **d** to the end of the **-Jx** (or **-JX**)
option. As an example, we want to plot a crude world map centered on
125ºE. Our command will be

  ::

    gmt set MAP_GRID_CROSS_SIZE_PRIMARY 0.1i MAP_FRAME_TYPE FANCY FORMAT_GEO_MAP ddd:mm:ssF
    gmt coast -Rg-55/305/-90/90 -Jx0.014i -Bagf -BWSen -Dc -A1000 -Glightbrown -Wthinnest
            -P -Slightblue > GMT_linear_d.ps

with the result reproduced in
Figure :ref:`Linear transformation of map coordinates <GMT_Linear_d>`.

Calendar time coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _GMT_linear_cal:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_linear_cal.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Linear transformation of calendar coordinates.


Several particular issues arise when we seek to make linear plots using
calendar date/time as the input coordinates. As far as setting up the
coordinate transformation we must indicate whether our input data have
absolute time coordinates or relative time coordinates. For the former
we append **T** after the axis scale (or width), while for the latter we
append **t** at the end of the **-Jx** (or **-JX**) option. However,
other command line arguments (like the **-R** option) may already
specify whether the time coordinate is absolute or relative. An absolute
time entry must be given as [*date*\ ]\ **T**\ [*clock*\ ] (with *date*
given as *yyyy*\ [-*mm*\ [-*dd*]], *yyyy*\ [-*jjj*], or
*yyyy*\ [-**W**\ *ww*\ [-*d*]], and *clock* using the
*hh*\ [:*mm*\ [:*ss*\ [*.xxx*]]] 24-hour clock format) whereas the
relative time is simply given as the units of time since the epoch
followed by **t** (see :ref:`TIME_UNIT <TIME_UNIT>` and :ref:`TIME_EPOCH <TIME_EPOCH>` for
information on specifying the time unit and the epoch). As a simple
example, we will make a plot of a school week calendar
(Figure :ref:`Linear transformation of calendar coordinates <GMT_linear_cal>`).

When the coordinate ranges provided by the **-R** option and the
projection type given by **-JX** (including the optional **d**, **g**,
**t** or **T**) conflict, GMT will warn the users about it. In
general, the options provided with **-JX** will prevail.

Cartesian logarithmic projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _GMT_log:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_log.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Logarithmic transformation of x--coordinates.


The :math:`\log_{10}` transformation is simply
:math:`u' = a \log_{10}(u) + b` and is selected by appending an **l**
(lower case L) immediately following the scale (or axis length) value.
Hence, to produce a plot in which the *x*-axis is logarithmic (the
*y*-axis remains linear, i.e., a semi-log plot), try (Figure :ref:`Logarithmic
transformation <GMT_log>`)

   ::

    gmt plot -R1/100/0/10 -Jx1.5il/0.15i -Bx2g3 -Bya2f1g2 -BWSne+gbisque
             -Wthick,blue,- -P -K -h sqrt.txt > GMT_log.ps
    gmt plot -R -J -Ss0.1i -N -Gred -W -O -h sqrt10.txt >> GMT_log.ps

Note that if *x*- and *y*-scaling are different and a
:math:`\log_{10}-\log_{10}` plot is desired, the **l** must be
appended twice: Once after the *x*-scale (before the /) and once after
the *y*-scale.

Cartesian power projection :ref:`... <-Jx_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _GMT_pow:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_pow.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Exponential or power transformation of x--coordinates.


This projection uses :math:`u' = a u^b + c` and allows us to explore
exponential relationships like :math:`x^p` versus :math:`y^q`.
While *p* and *q* can be any values, we will select *p
= 0.5* and *q = 1* which means we will plot *x* versus
:math:`\sqrt{x}`. We indicate this scaling by appending a **p** (lower
case P) followed by the desired exponent, in our case 0.5. Since
*q = 1* we do not need to specify **p**\ 1 since it is identical
to the linear transformation. Thus our command becomes (Figure :ref:`Power
transformation <GMT_pow>`)

   ::

    gmt plot -R0/100/0/10 -Jx0.3ip0.5/0.15i -Bxa1p -Bya2f1 -BWSne+givory
             -Wthick -P -K sqrt.txt > GMT_pow.ps

Linear projection with polar coordinates (**-Jp** **-JP**) :ref:`... <-Jp_full>`
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _GMT_polar:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_polar.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Polar (Cylindrical) transformation of (:math:`\theta, r`) coordinates.


This transformation converts polar coordinates (angle :math:`\theta` and
radius *r*) to positions on a plot. Now :math:`x' = f(\theta,r)`
and :math:`y' = g(\theta,r)`, hence it is similar to a regular map
projection because *x* and *y* are coupled and *x*
(i.e., :math:`\theta`) has a 360º periodicity. With input and output
points both in the plane it is a **two-dimensional** projection. The
transformation comes in two flavors:

#. Normally, :math:`\theta` is understood to be directions
   counter-clockwise from the horizontal axis, but we may choose to
   specify an angular offset [whose default value is zero]. We will call
   this offset :math:`\theta_0`. Then,
   :math:`x' = f(\theta, r) = ar \cos (\theta-\theta_0) + b` and
   :math:`y' = g(\theta, r) = ar \sin (\theta-\theta_0) + c`.

#. Alternatively, :math:`\theta` can be interpreted to be azimuths
   clockwise from the vertical axis, yet we may again choose to specify
   the angular offset [whose default value is zero]. Then,
   :math:`x' = f(\theta, r) = ar \cos (90 - (\theta-\theta_0)) + b` and
   :math:`y' = g(\theta, r) = ar \sin (90 - (\theta-\theta_0)) + c`.

Consequently, the polar transformation is defined by providing

-  scale in inches/unit (**-Jp**) or full width of plot in inches (**-JP**)

-  Optionally, insert **a** after **p\ \| \ P** to indicate CW
   azimuths rather than CCW directions

-  Optionally, append /\ *origin* in degrees to indicate an angular offset [0]

-  Optionally, append **r** to reverse the radial direction (here,
   *south* and *north* must be elevations in 0--90 range).

-  Optionally, append **z** to annotate depths rather than radius.

As an example of this projection we will create a gridded data set in
polar coordinates :math:`z(\theta, r) = r^2 \cdot \cos{4\theta}` using
:doc:`grdmath`, a RPN calculator that
operates on or creates grid files.

   ::

    gmt grdmath -R0/360/2/4 -I6/0.1 X 4 MUL PI MUL 180 DIV COS Y 2 POW MUL = tt.nc
    gmt grdcontour tt.nc -JP3i -B30 -BNs+ghoneydew -P -C2 -S4 --FORMAT_GEO_MAP=+ddd > GMT_polar.ps

We used :doc:`grdcontour` to make a
contour map of this data. Because the data file only contains values
with :math:`2 \leq r \leq 4`, a donut shaped plot appears in
Figure :ref:`Polar transformation <GMT_polar>`.


GMT Map Projections
===================

GMT implements more than 30 different projections. They all project
the input coordinates longitude and latitude to positions on a map. In
general, *x' = f(x,y,z)* and *y' = g(x,y,z)*, where
*z* is implicitly given as the radial vector length to the
*(x,y)* point on the chosen ellipsoid. The functions *f* and
*g* can be quite nasty and we will refrain from presenting details
in this document. The interested read is referred to *Snyder*
[1987] [20]_. We will mostly be using the
:doc:`coast` command to demonstrate each of
the projections. GMT map projections are grouped into four categories
depending on the nature of the projection. The groups are

#. Conic map projections

#. Azimuthal map projections

#. Cylindrical map projections

#. Miscellaneous projections

Because *x* and *y* are coupled we can only specify one
plot-dimensional scale, typically a map *scale* (for lower-case map
projection code) or a map *width* (for upper-case map projection code).
However, in some cases it would be more practical to specify map
*height* instead of *width*, while in other situations it would be nice
to set either the *shortest* or *longest* map dimension. Users may
select these alternatives by appending a character code to their map
dimension. To specify map *height*, append **h** to the given dimension;
to select the minimum map dimension, append **-**, whereas you may
append **+** to select the maximum map dimension. Without the modifier
the map width is selected by default.

In GMT version 4.3.0 we noticed we ran out of the alphabet for
1-letter (and sometimes 2-letter) projection codes. To allow more
flexibility, and to make it easier to remember the codes, we implemented
the option to use the abbreviations used by the **Proj4** mapping
package. Since some of the GMT projections are not in **Proj4**, we
invented some of our own as well. For a full list of both the old 1- and
2-letter codes, as well as the **Proj4**-equivalents see the quick
reference cards in Section `GMT quick reference`_. For example, **-JM**\ 15c and
**-JMerc**\ /15c have the same meaning.

Conic projections
-----------------

Albers conic equal-area projection (**-Jb** **-JB**) :ref:`... <-Jb_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This projection, developed by Albers in 1805, is predominantly used to
map regions of large east-west extent, in particular the United States.
It is a conic, equal-area projection, in which parallels are unequally
spaced arcs of concentric circles, more closely spaced at the north and
south edges of the map. Meridians, on the other hand, are equally spaced
radii about a common center, and cut the parallels at right angles.
Distortion in scale and shape vanishes along the two standard parallels.
Between them, the scale along parallels is too small; beyond them it is
too large. The opposite is true for the scale along meridians. To define
the projection in GMT you need to provide the following information:

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Two standard parallels.

-  Map scale in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx notation (**-Jb**), or map width (**-JB**).

Note that you must include the "1:" if you choose to specify the scale
that way. E.g., you can say 0.5 which means 0.5 inch/degree or 1:200000
which means 1 inch on the map equals 200,000 inches along the standard
parallels. The projection center defines the origin of the rectangular
map coordinates. As an example we will make a map of the region near
Taiwan. We choose the center of the projection to be at 125ºE/20ºN and
25ºN and 45ºN as our two standard parallels. We desire a map that is 5
inches wide. The complete command needed to generate the map below is
therefore given by:

Equidistant conic projection (**-Jd** **-JD**) :ref:`... <-Jd_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The equidistant conic projection was described by the Greek philosopher
Claudius Ptolemy about A.D. 150. It is neither conformal or equal-area,
but serves as a compromise between them. The scale is true along all
meridians and the standard parallels. To select this projection in
GMT you must provide the same information as for the other conic
projection, i.e.,

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Two standard parallels.

-  Map scale in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx notation (**-Jd**), or map width (**-JD**).

The equidistant conic projection is often used for atlases with maps of
small countries. As an example, we generate a map of Cuba:

Lambert conic conformal projection (**-Jl** **-JL**) :ref:`... <-Jl_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This conic projection was designed by the Alsatian mathematician Johann
Heinrich Lambert (1772) and has been used extensively for mapping of
regions with predominantly east-west orientation, just like the Albers
projection. Unlike the Albers projection, Lambert's conformal projection
is not equal-area. The parallels are arcs of circles with a common
origin, and meridians are the equally spaced radii of these circles. As
with Albers projection, it is only the two standard parallels that are
distortion-free. To select this projection in GMT you must provide the
same information as for the Albers projection, i.e.,

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Two standard parallels.

-  Map scale in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx notation (**-Jl**), or map width (**-JL**).

The Lambert conformal projection has been used for basemaps for all the
48 contiguous States with the two fixed standard parallels 33ºN and 45ºN.
We will generate a map of the continental USA using these parameters.
Note that with all the projections you have the option of selecting a
rectangular border rather than one defined by meridians and parallels.
Here, we choose the regular WESN region, a "fancy" basemap frame, and
use degrees west for longitudes. The generating commands used were

   ::

   :align: center

   Lambert conformal conic map projection.


The choice for projection center does not affect the projection but it
indicates which meridian (here 100ºW) will be vertical on the map. The
standard parallels were originally selected by Adams to provide a
maximum scale error between latitudes 30.5ºN and 47.5ºN of 0.5--1%. Some
areas, like Florida, experience scale errors of up to 2.5%.

(American) polyconic projection (**-Jpoly** **-JPoly**) :ref:`... <-Jpoly_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The polyconic projection, in Europe usually referred to as the American
polyconic projection, was introduced shortly before 1820 by the
Swiss-American cartographer Ferdinand Rodulph Hassler (1770--1843). As
head of the Survey of the Coast, he was looking for a projection that
would give the least distortion for mapping the coast of the United
States. The projection acquired its name from the construction of each
parallel, which is achieved by projecting the parallel onto the cone
while it is rolled around the globe, along the central meridian, tangent
to that parallel. As a consequence, the projection involves many cones
rather than a single one used in regular conic projections.

The polyconic projection is neither equal-area, nor conformal. It is
true to scale without distortion along the central meridian. Each
parallel is true to scale as well, but the meridians are not as they get
further away from the central meridian. As a consequence, no parallel is
standard because conformity is lost with the lengthening of the meridians.

Below we reproduce the illustration by *Snyder* [1987], with a gridline
every 10 and annotations only every 30º in longitude:

Azimuthal projections
---------------------

Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area (**-Ja** **-JA**)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This projection was developed by Lambert in 1772 and is typically used
for mapping large regions like continents and hemispheres. It is an
azimuthal, equal-area projection, but is not perspective. Distortion is
zero at the center of the projection, and increases radially away from
this point. To define this projection in GMT you must provide the
following information:

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Optionally, the horizon, i.e., the number of degrees from the center
   to the edge (<= 180, default is 90).

-  Scale as 1:xxxxx or as radius/latitude where radius is the projected
   distance on the map from projection center to an oblique latitude where 0
   would be the oblique Equator
   (**-Ja**), or map width (**-JA**).

Two different types of maps can be made with this projection depending
on how the region is specified. We will give examples of both types.

Rectangular map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode we define our region by specifying the longitude/latitude
of the lower left and upper right corners instead of the usual *west,
east, south, north* boundaries. The reason for specifying our area this
way is that for this and many other projections, lines of equal
longitude and latitude are not straight lines and are thus poor choices
for map boundaries. Instead we require that the map boundaries be
rectangular by defining the corners of a rectangular map boundary. Using
0ºE/40ºS (lower left) and 60ºE/10ºS (upper right) as our corners we try

   ::

    gmt set FORMAT_GEO_MAP ddd:mm:ssF MAP_GRID_CROSS_SIZE_PRIMARY 0
    gmt coast -R0/-40/60/-10r -JA30/-30/4.5i -Bag -Dl -A500 -Gp300/10

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_lambert_az_rect.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Rectangular map using the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection.


Note that an "r" is appended to the **-R** option to inform GMT that
the region has been selected using the rectangle technique, otherwise it
would try to decode the values as *west, east, south, north* and report
an error since *'east'* < *'west'*.

Hemisphere map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, you must specify the world as your region (**-Rg** or
**-Rd**). E.g., to obtain a hemisphere view that shows the Americas, try

   ::

    gmt coast -Rg -JA280/30/3.5i -Bg -Dc -A1000 -Gnavy > GMT_lambert_az_hemi.ps

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_lambert_az_hemi.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Hemisphere map using the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection.


To geologists, the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection (with origin
at 0/0) is known as the *equal-area* (Schmidt) stereonet and used for
plotting fold axes, fault planes, and the like. An *equal-angle* (Wulff)
stereonet can be obtained by using the stereographic projection
(discussed later). The stereonets produced by these two projections appear below.

.. _GMT_stereonets:

Stereographic Equal-Angle projection (**-Js** **-JS**) :ref:`... <-Js_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a conformal, azimuthal projection that dates back to the Greeks.
Its main use is for mapping the polar regions. In the polar aspect all
meridians are straight lines and parallels are arcs of circles. While
this is the most common use it is possible to select any point as the
center of projection. The requirements are

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Optionally, the horizon, i.e., the number of degrees from the center
   to the edge (< 180, default is 90).

-  Scale as 1:xxxxx (true scale at pole), slat/1:xxxxx (true scale at
   standard parallel slat), or radius/latitude where radius is distance
   on map in inches from projection center to a particular
   oblique latitude (**-Js**), or simply map width (**-JS**).

A default map scale factor of 0.9996 will be applied by default
(although you may change this with :ref:`PROJ_SCALE_FACTOR <PROJ_SCALE_FACTOR>`). However,
the setting is ignored when a standard parallel has been specified since
the scale is then implicitly given. We will look at two different types
of maps.

Polar Stereographic Map :ref:`... <-Js_full>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In our first example we will let the projection center be at the north
pole. This means we have a polar stereographic projection and the map
boundaries will coincide with lines of constant longitude and latitude.
An example is given by

   ::

   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Polar stereographic conformal projection.


Rectangular stereographic map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As with Lambert's azimuthal equal-area projection we have the option to
use rectangular boundaries rather than the wedge-shape typically
associated with polar projections. This choice is defined by selecting
two points as corners in the rectangle and appending an "r" to the
**-R** option. This command produces a map as presented in
Figure :ref:`Polar stereographic <GMT_stereographic_rect>`:

   ::

    gmt set MAP_ANNOT_OBLIQUE 30

.. _GMT_stereographic_rect:

   :align: center

General stereographic map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In terms of usage this projection is identical to the Lambert azimuthal
equal-area projection. Thus, one can make both rectangular and
hemispheric maps. Our example shows Australia using a projection pole at
130ºE/30ºS. The command used was

   ::

    gmt set MAP_ANNOT_OBLIQUE 0
    gmt coast -R100/-42/160/-8r -JS130/-30/4i -Bag -Dl -A500 -Ggreen -Slightblue -Wthinnest > GMT_stereographic_general.ps

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_stereographic_general.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   General stereographic conformal projection with rectangular borders.


By choosing 0/0 as the pole, we obtain the conformal stereonet presented
next to its equal-area cousin in the Section `Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area (-Ja -JA)`_ on the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection (Figure :ref:`Stereonets <GMT_stereonets>`).

Perspective projection (**-Jg** **-JG**) :ref:`... <-Jg_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The perspective projection imitates in 2 dimensions the 3-dimensional
view of the earth from space. The implementation in GMT is very
flexible, and thus requires many input variables. Those are listed and
explained below, with the values used in
Figure :ref:`Perspective projection <GMT_perspective>` between brackets.

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center (4ºE/52ºN).

-  Altitude of the viewer above sea level in kilometers (230 km). If
   this value is less than 10, it is assumed to be the distance of the
   viewer from the center of the earth in earth radii. If an "r" is
   appended, it is the distance from the center of the earth in
   kilometers.

-  Azimuth in degrees (90, due east). This is the direction in which you
   are looking, measured clockwise from north.

-  Tilt in degrees (60). This is the viewing angle relative to zenith.
   So a tilt of 0º is looking straight down, 60º is looking from 30º above
   the horizon.

-  Twist in degrees (180). This is the boresight rotation (clockwise) of
   the image. The twist of 180º in the example mimics the fact that the
   Space Shuttle flies upside down.

-  Width and height of the viewpoint in degrees (60). This number
   depends on whether you are looking with the naked eye (in which case
   you view is about 60º wide), or with binoculars, for example.

-  Scale as 1:xxxxx or as radius/latitude where radius is distance on
   map in inches from projection center to a particular
   oblique latitude (**-Jg**), or map width (**-JG**) (5 inches).

The imagined view of northwest Europe from a Space Shuttle at 230 km
looking due east is thus accomplished by the following
:doc:`coast` command:

   ::

    gmt coast -Rg -JG4/52/230/90/60/180/60/60/5i -Bx2g2 -By1g1 -Ia -Di -Glightbrown -Wthinnest -Slightblue --MAP_ANNOT_MIN_SPACING=0.25i > GMT_perspective.ps

Orthographic projection (**-Jg** **-JG**) :ref:`... <-Jg_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The orthographic azimuthal projection is a perspective projection from
infinite distance. It is therefore often used to give the appearance of
a globe viewed from outer space. As with Lambert's equal-area and the
stereographic projection, only one hemisphere can be viewed at any time.
The projection is neither equal-area nor conformal, and much distortion
is introduced near the edge of the hemisphere. The directions from the
center of projection are true. The projection was known to the Egyptians
and Greeks more than 2,000 years ago. Because it is mainly used for
pictorial views at a small scale, only the spherical form is necessary.

To specify the orthographic projection the same options **-Jg** or
**-JG** as the perspective projection are used, but with fewer variables to supply:

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Optionally, the horizon, i.e., the number of degrees from the center
   to the edge (<= 90, default is 90).

-  Scale as 1:xxxxx or as radius/latitude where radius is distance on
   map in inches from projection center to a particular
   oblique latitude (**-Jg**), or map width (**-JG**).

Our example of a perspective view centered on 75ºW/40ºN can therefore be
generated by the following :doc:`coast` command:

   :align: center

Azimuthal Equidistant projection (**-Je** **-JE**) :ref:`... <-Je_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most noticeable feature of this azimuthal projection is the fact
that distances measured from the center are true. Therefore, a circle
about the projection center defines the locus of points that are equally
far away from the plot origin. Furthermore, directions from the center
are also true. The projection, in the polar aspect, is at least several
centuries old. It is a useful projection for a global view of locations
at various or identical distance from a given point (the map center).

To specify the azimuthal equidistant projection you must supply:

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Optionally, the horizon, i.e., the number of degrees from the center
   to the edge (<= 180, default is 180).

-  Scale as 1:xxxxx or as radius/latitude where radius is distance on
   map in inches from projection center to a particular
   oblique latitude (**-Je**), or map width (**-JE**).

Our example of a global view centered on 100ºW/40ºN can therefore be
generated by the following :doc:`coast`
command. Note that the antipodal point is 180º away from the center, but
in this projection this point plots as the entire map perimeter:

Gnomonic projection (**-Jf** **-JF**) :ref:`... <-Jf_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Gnomonic azimuthal projection is a perspective projection from the
center onto a plane tangent to the surface. Its origin goes back to the
old Greeks who used it for star maps almost 2500 years ago. The
projection is neither equal-area nor conformal, and much distortion is
introduced near the edge of the hemisphere; in fact, less than a
hemisphere may be shown around a given center. The directions from the
center of projection are true. Great circles project onto straight
lines. Because it is mainly used for pictorial views at a small scale,
only the spherical form is necessary.

To specify the Gnomonic projection you must supply:

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Optionally, the horizon, i.e., the number of degrees from the center
   to the edge (< 90, default is 60).

-  Scale as 1:xxxxx or as radius/latitude where radius is distance on
   map in inches from projection center to a particular
   oblique latitude (**-Jf**), or map width (**-JF**).

Using a horizon of 60, our example of this projection centered on
120ºW/35ºN can therefore be generated by the following :doc:`coast` command:

   ::

    gmt coast -Rg -JF-120/35/60/4.5i -B30g15 -Dc -A10000 -Gtan -Scyan -Wthinnest > GMT_gnomonic.ps

Cylindrical projections
-----------------------

Cylindrical projections are easily recognized for its shape: maps are
rectangular and meridians and parallels are straight lines crossing at
right angles. But that is where similarities between the cylindrical
projections supported by GMT (Mercator, transverse Mercator, universal
transverse Mercator, oblique Mercator, Cassini, cylindrical equidistant,
cylindrical equal-area, Miller, and cylindrical stereographic
projections) stops. Each have a different way of spacing the meridians
and parallels to obtain certain desirable cartographic properties.

Mercator projection (**-Jm** **-JM**) :ref:`... <-Jm_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Probably the most famous of the various map projections, the Mercator
projection takes its name from the Flemish cartographer Gheert Cremer,
better known as Gerardus Mercator, who presented it in 1569. The
projection is a cylindrical and conformal, with no distortion along the
equator. A major navigational feature of the projection is that a line
of constant azimuth is straight. Such a line is called a rhumb line or
*loxodrome*. Thus, to sail from one point to another one only had to
connect the points with a straight line, determine the azimuth of the
line, and keep this constant course for the entire voyage [21]_. The
Mercator projection has been used extensively for world maps in which
the distortion towards the polar regions grows rather large, thus
incorrectly giving the impression that, for example, Greenland is larger
than South America. In reality, the latter is about eight times the size
of Greenland. Also, the Former Soviet Union looks much bigger than
Africa or South America. One may wonder whether this illusion has had
any influence on U.S. foreign policy.

In the regular Mercator projection, the cylinder touches the globe along
the equator. Other orientations like vertical and oblique give rise to
the Transverse and Oblique Mercator projections, respectively. We will
discuss these generalizations following the regular Mercator projection.

The regular Mercator projection requires a minimum of parameters. To use
it in GMT programs you supply this information (the first two items
are optional and have defaults):

-  Central meridian [Middle of your map].

-  Standard parallel for true scale [Equator]. When supplied, central
   meridian must be supplied as well.

-  Scale along the equator in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx (**-Jm**), or map
   width (**-JM**).

Our example presents a world map at a scale of 0.012 inch pr degree
which will give a map 4.32 inch wide. It was created with the command:

   ::

    gmt coast -R0/360/-70/70 -Jm1.2e-2i -Bxa60f15 -Bya30f15 -Dc -A5000 -Gred > GMT_mercator.ps

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_mercator.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Simple Mercator map.


While this example is centered on the Dateline, one can easily choose
another configuration with the **-R** option. A map centered on
Greenwich would specify the region with **-R**-180/180/-70/70.

Transverse Mercator projection (**-Jt** **-JT**) :ref:`... <-Jt_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The transverse Mercator was invented by Lambert in 1772. In this
projection the cylinder touches a meridian along which there is no
distortion. The distortion increases away from the central meridian and
goes to infinity at 90º from center. The central meridian, each meridian
90º away from the center, and equator are straight lines; other parallels
and meridians are complex curves. The projection is defined by
specifying:

-  The central meridian.

-  Optionally, the latitude of origin (default is the equator).

-  Scale along the equator in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx (**-Jt**), or map
   width (**-JT**).

The optional latitude of origin defaults to Equator if not specified.
Although defaulting to 1, you can change the map scale factor via the
:ref:`PROJ_SCALE_FACTOR <PROJ_SCALE_FACTOR>` parameter. Our example shows a transverse
Mercator map of south-east Europe and the Middle East with 35ºE as the
central meridian:

   ::

    gmt coast -R20/30/50/45r -Jt35/0.18i -Bag -Dl -A250 -Glightbrown -Wthinnest -Sseashell > GMT_transverse_merc.ps

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_transverse_merc.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Rectangular Transverse Mercator map.


The transverse Mercator can also be used to generate a global map - the
equivalent of the 360º Mercator map. Using the command

   ::

    gmt coast -R0/360/-80/80 -JT330/-45/3.5i -Ba30g -BWSne -Dc -A2000 -Slightblue -G0 > GMT_TM.ps

we made the map illustrated in Figure :ref:`Global transverse Mercator
<GMT_TM>`. Note that
when a world map is given (indicated by **-R**\ *0/360/s/n*), the
arguments are interpreted to mean oblique degrees, i.e., the 360º range
is understood to mean the extent of the plot along the central meridian,
while the "south" and "north" values represent how far from the central
longitude we want the plot to extend. These values correspond to
latitudes in the regular Mercator projection and must therefore be less
than 90.

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection (**-Ju** **-JU**) :ref:`... <-Ju_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A particular subset of the transverse Mercator is the Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) which was adopted by the US Army for
large-scale military maps. Here, the globe is divided into 60 zones
between 84ºS and 84ºN, most of which are 6 wide. Each of these UTM zones
have their unique central meridian. Furthermore, each zone is divided
into latitude bands but these are not needed to specify the projection
for most cases. See Figure :ref:`Universal Transverse Mercator
<GMT_utm_zones>` for all zone designations.

.. _GMT_utm_zones:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_utm_zones.*
   :width: 700 px
   :align: center

   Universal Transverse Mercator zone layout.


GMT implements both the transverse Mercator and the UTM projection.
When selecting UTM you must specify:

-  UTM zone (A, B, 1--60, Y, Z). Use negative values for numerical zones
   in the southern hemisphere or append the latitude modifiers C--H, J--N,
   P--X) to specify an exact UTM grid zone.

-  Scale along the equator in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx (**-Ju**), or map
   width (**-JU**).

In order to minimize the distortion in any given zone, a scale factor of
0.9996 has been factored into the formulae. (although a standard, you
can change this with :ref:`PROJ_SCALE_FACTOR <PROJ_SCALE_FACTOR>`). This makes the UTM
projection a *secant* projection and not a *tangent* projection like the
transverse Mercator above. The scale only varies by 1 part in 1,000 from
true scale at equator. The ellipsoidal projection expressions are
accurate for map areas that extend less than 10 away from the central
meridian. For larger regions we use the conformal latitude in the
general spherical formulae instead.

Oblique Mercator projection (**-Jo** **-JO**) :ref:`... <-Jo_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oblique configurations of the cylinder give rise to the oblique Mercator
projection. It is particularly useful when mapping regions of large
lateral extent in an oblique direction. Both parallels and meridians are
complex curves. The projection was developed in the early 1900s by
several workers. Several parameters must be provided to define the
projection. GMT offers three different definitions:

#. Option **-Jo**\ [**a**\ \|\ **A**] or **-JO**\ [**a**\ \|\ **A**]:

   -  Longitude and latitude of projection center.

   -  Azimuth of the oblique equator.

   -  Scale in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx along oblique equator (**-Jo**),
      or map width (**-JO**).

#. Option **-Jo**\ [**b**\ \|\ **B**] or **-JO**\ [**b**\ \|\ **B**]:

   -  Longitude and latitude of projection center.

   -  Longitude and latitude of second point on oblique equator.

   -  Scale in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx along oblique equator (**-Jo**),
      or map width (**-JO**).

#. Option **-Joc**\ \|\ **C** or **-JOc**\ \|\ **C**:

   -  Longitude and latitude of projection center.

   -  Longitude and latitude of projection pole.

   -  Scale in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx along oblique equator (**-Jo**),
      or map width (**-JO**).

For all three definitions, the upper case **A**\ \|\ **B**\ \|\ **C** means we
will allow projection poles in the southern hemisphere [By default we map any such
poles to their antipodes in the north hemisphere].  Our example was produced by the command

   ::

   adding a star rose with the **-Td** option.


It uses definition 3 for an oblique view of some Caribbean islands. Note
that we define our region using the rectangular system described
earlier. If we do not append an "r" to the **-R** string then the
information provided with the **-R** option is assumed to be oblique
degrees about the projection center rather than the usual geographic
coordinates. This interpretation is chosen since in general the
parallels and meridians are not very suitable as map boundaries.

When working with oblique projections such as here, it is often much more convenient
to specify the map domain in the projected coordinates relative to the map center.
The figure below shows two views of New Zealand using the oblique Mercator projection
that in both cases specifies the region using **-Rk**\ -1000/1000/-500/500.  The leading
unit **k** means the following bounds are in projected km and we let GMT determine the
geographic coordinates of the two diagonal corners internally.

   indicated by the white circle for an oblique Equator with azimuth 35.  This

   The map is 2000 km by 1000 km and the Cartesian
   coordinate system in the projected units are indicated by the bold axes.  The blue
   circle is the point (40S,180E) and it has projected coordinates (*x* = 426.2, *y* = -399.7).

   i.e., **-JOA**\ 173:17:02E/41:16:15S/215/3i.)
   The projected coordinate system is still aligned as before but the Earth has been rotated
   180 degrees.  The blue point now has projected coordinates (*x* = -426.2, *y* = 399.7).

Cassini cylindrical projection (**-Jc** **-JC**) :ref:`... <-Jc_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This cylindrical projection was developed in 1745 by César-François
Cassini de Thury for the survey of France. It is occasionally called
Cassini-Soldner since the latter provided the more accurate mathematical
analysis that led to the development of the ellipsoidal formulae. The
projection is neither conformal nor equal-area, and behaves as a
compromise between the two end-members. The distortion is zero along the
central meridian. It is best suited for mapping regions of north-south
extent. The central meridian, each meridian 90º away, and equator are
straight lines; all other meridians and parallels are complex curves.
The requirements to define this projection are:

-  Longitude and latitude of central point.

-  Scale in inch/degree or as 1:xxxxx (**-Jc**), or map width (**-JC**).

A detailed map of the island of Sardinia centered on the 8º45'E meridian
using the Cassini projection can be obtained by running the command:

   ::

    gmt coast -R7:30/38:30/10:30/41:30r -JC8.75/40/2.5i -Bafg -LjBR+c40+w100+f+o0.15i/0.2i -Gspringgreen -Dh -Sazure -Wthinnest -Ia/thinner --FONT_LABEL=12p > GMT_cassini.ps

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_cassini.*

As with the previous projections, the user can choose between a
rectangular boundary (used here) or a geographical (WESN) boundary.

Cylindrical equidistant projection (**-Jq** **-JQ**) :ref:`... <-Jq_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This simple cylindrical projection is really a linear scaling of
longitudes and latitudes. The most common form is the Plate Carrée
projection, where the scaling of longitudes and latitudes is the same.
All meridians and parallels are straight lines. The projection can be
defined by:

-  The central meridian [Middle of your map].

-  Standard parallel [Equator].

-  Scale in inch/degree or as 1:xxxxx (**-Jq**), or map width (**-JQ**).

The first two of these are optional and have defaults. When the standard
parallel is defined, the central meridian must be supplied as well.

A world map centered on the dateline using this projection can be
obtained by running the command:

   ::

    gmt coast -Rg -JQ4.5i -B60f30g30 -Dc -A5000 -Gtan4 -Slightcyan > GMT_equi_cyl.ps

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_equi_cyl.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   World map using the Plate Carrée projection.


Different relative scalings of longitudes and latitudes can be obtained
by selecting a standard parallel different from the equator. Some
selections for standard parallels have practical properties as shown in
Table :ref:`JQ <tbl-JQ>`.

Cylindrical equal-area projections (**-Jy** **-JY**) :ref:`... <-Jy_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This cylindrical projection is actually several projections, depending
on what latitude is selected as the standard parallel. However, they are
all equal area and hence non-conformal. All meridians and parallels are
straight lines. The requirements to define this projection are:

-  The central meridian.

-  The standard parallel.

-  Scale in inch/degree or as 1:xxxxx (**-Jy**), or map width (**-JY**)

While you may choose any value for the standard parallel and obtain your
own personal projection, there are seven choices of standard parallels
that result in known (or named) projections. These are listed in Table :ref:`JY <tbl-JY>`.

.. _tbl-JY:

For instance, a world map centered on the 35ºE meridian using the Behrman
projection (Figure :ref:`Behrman cylindrical projection <GMT_general_cyl>`)
can be obtained by running the command:

   ::

    gmt coast -R-145/215/-90/90 -JY35/30/4.5i -B45g45 -Dc -A10000 -Sdodgerblue -Wthinnest > GMT_general_cyl.ps

As one can see there is considerable distortion at high latitudes since
the poles map into lines.

Miller Cylindrical projection (**-Jj** **-JJ**) :ref:`... <-Jj_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This cylindrical projection, presented by Osborn Maitland Miller of the
American Geographic Society in 1942, is neither equal nor conformal. All
meridians and parallels are straight lines. The projection was designed
to be a compromise between Mercator and other cylindrical projections.
Specifically, Miller spaced the parallels by using Mercator's formula
with 0.8 times the actual latitude, thus avoiding the singular poles;
the result was then divided by 0.8. There is only a spherical form for
this projection. Specify the projection by:

-  Optionally, the central meridian (default is the middle of your map).

-  Scale in inch/degree or as 1:xxxxx (**-Jj**), or map width (**-JJ**).

For instance, a world map centered on the 90ºE meridian at a map scale of
1:400,000,000 (Figure :ref:`Miller projection <GMT_miller>`) can be obtained as
follows:

   ::

    gmt coast -R-90/270/-80/90 -Jj1:400000000 -Bx45g45 -By30g30 -Dc -A10000 -Gkhaki -Wthinnest -Sazure > GMT_miller.ps

Cylindrical stereographic projections (**-Jcyl_stere** **-JCyl_stere**) :ref:`... <-Jcyl_stere_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cylindrical stereographic projections are certainly not as notable
as other cylindrical projections, but are still used because of their
relative simplicity and their ability to overcome some of the downsides
of other cylindrical projections, like extreme distortions of the higher
latitudes. The stereographic projections are perspective projections,
projecting the sphere onto a cylinder in the direction of the antipodal
point on the equator. The cylinder crosses the sphere at two standard
parallels, equidistant from the equator. The projections are defined by:

-  The central meridian (uses the middle of the map when omitted).

-  The standard parallel (default is the Equator). When used, central
   meridian needs to be given as well.

-  Scale in inch/degree or as 1:xxxxx (**-Jcyl_stere**), or map width
   (**-JCyl_stere**)

Some of the selections of the standard parallel are named for the
cartographer or publication that popularized the projection
(Table :ref:`JCylstere <tbl-JCylstere>`).

.. _tbl-JCylstere:

Miscellaneous projections
-------------------------

GMT supports 8 common projections for global presentation of data or
models. These are the Hammer, Mollweide, Winkel Tripel, Robinson, Eckert
IV and VI, Sinusoidal, and Van der Grinten projections. Due to the small
scale used for global maps these projections all use the spherical
approximation rather than more elaborate elliptical formulae.

In all cases, the specification of the central meridian can be skipped.
The default is the middle of the longitude range of the plot, specified
by the (**-R**) option.

Hammer projection (**-Jh** **-JH**) :ref:`... <-Jh_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The equal-area Hammer projection, first presented by the German
mathematician Ernst von Hammer in 1892, is also known as Hammer-Aitoff
(the Aitoff projection looks similar, but is not equal-area). The border
is an ellipse, equator and central meridian are straight lines, while
other parallels and meridians are complex curves. The projection is
defined by selecting:

-  The central meridian [Middle of your map].

-  Scale along equator in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx (**-Jh**), or map width (**-JH**).

A view of the Pacific ocean using the Dateline as central meridian is accomplished thus

   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   World map using the Hammer projection.


Mollweide projection (**-Jw** **-JW**) :ref:`... <-Jw_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This pseudo-cylindrical, equal-area projection was developed by the
German mathematician and astronomer Karl Brandan Mollweide in 1805.
Parallels are unequally spaced straight lines with the meridians being
equally spaced elliptical arcs. The scale is only true along latitudes
4044' north and south. The projection is used mainly for global maps
showing data distributions. It is occasionally referenced under the name
homalographic projection. Like the Hammer projection, outlined above, we
need to specify only two parameters to completely define the mapping of
longitudes and latitudes into rectangular *x*/*y* coordinates:

-  The central meridian [Middle of your map].

-  Scale along equator in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx (**-Jw**), or map width (**-JW**).

An example centered on Greenwich can be generated thus:

   ::

    gmt coast -Rd -JW4.5i -Bg -Dc -A10000 -Gtomato1 -Sskyblue > GMT_mollweide.ps

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_mollweide.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   World map using the Mollweide projection.


Winkel Tripel projection (**-Jr** **-JR**) :ref:`... <-Jr_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 1921, the German mathematician Oswald Winkel a projection that was to
strike a compromise between the properties of three elements (area,
angle and distance). The German word "tripel" refers to this junction of
where each of these elements are least distorted when plotting global
maps. The projection was popularized when Bartholomew and Son started to
use it in its world-renowned "The Times Atlas of the World" in the mid
20th century. In 1998, the National Geographic Society made the Winkel
Tripel as its map projection of choice for global maps.

Naturally, this projection is neither conformal, nor equal-area. Central
meridian and equator are straight lines; other parallels and meridians
are curved. The projection is obtained by averaging the coordinates of
the Equidistant Cylindrical and Aitoff (not Hammer-Aitoff) projections.
The poles map into straight lines 0.4 times the length of equator. To
use it you must enter

-  The central meridian [Middle of your map].

-  Scale along equator in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx (**-Jr**), or map width (**-JR**).

Centered on Greenwich, the example in Figure :ref:`Winkel Tripel projection
<GMT_winkel>` was created by this command:

   ::

    gmt coast -Rd -JR4.5i -Bg -Dc -A10000 -Gburlywood4 -Swheat1 > GMT_winkel.ps

.. _GMT_winkel:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_winkel.*

Robinson projection (**-Jn** **-JN**) :ref:`... <-Jn_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Robinson projection, presented by the American geographer and
cartographer Arthur H. Robinson in 1963, is a modified cylindrical
projection that is neither conformal nor equal-area. Central meridian
and all parallels are straight lines; other meridians are curved. It
uses lookup tables rather than analytic expressions to make the world
map "look" right [22]_. The scale is true along latitudes 38. The
projection was originally developed for use by Rand McNally and is
currently used by the National Geographic Society. To use it you must
enter

-  The central meridian [Middle of your map].

-  Scale along equator in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx (**-Jn**), or map width
   (**-JN**).

Again centered on Greenwich, the example below was created by this command:

   ::

    gmt coast -Rd -JN4.5i -Bg -Dc -A10000 -Ggoldenrod -Ssnow2 > GMT_robinson.ps

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_robinson.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   World map using the Robinson projection.


Eckert IV and VI projection (**-Jk** **-JK**) :ref:`... <-Jk_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Eckert IV and VI projections, presented by the German cartographer
Max Eckert-Greiffendorff in 1906, are pseudo-cylindrical equal-area
projections. Central meridian and all parallels are straight lines;
other meridians are equally spaced elliptical arcs (IV) or sinusoids
(VI). The scale is true along latitudes 40º30' (IV) and 49º16' (VI). Their
main use is in thematic world maps. To select Eckert IV you must use
**-JKf** (**f** for "four") while Eckert VI is selected with **-JKs**
(**s** for "six"). If no modifier is given it defaults to Eckert VI. In
addition, you must enter

-  The central meridian [Middle of your map].

-  Scale along equator in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx (**-Jk**), or map width
   (**-JK**).

Centered on the Dateline, the Eckert IV example below was created by
this command:

   ::

    gmt coast -Rg -JKf4.5i -Bg -Dc -A10000 -Wthinnest -Givory -Sbisque3 > GMT_eckert4.ps

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_eckert4.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   World map using the Eckert IV projection.


The same script, with **s** instead of **f**, yields the Eckert VI map:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_eckert6.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   World map using the Eckert VI projection.


Sinusoidal projection (**-Ji** **-JI**) :ref:`... <-Ji_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sinusoidal projection is one of the oldest known projections, is
equal-area, and has been used since the mid-16th century. It has also
been called the "Equal-area Mercator" projection. The central meridian
is a straight line; all other meridians are sinusoidal curves. Parallels
are all equally spaced straight lines, with scale being true along all
parallels (and central meridian). To use it, you need to select:

-  The central meridian [Middle of your map].

-  Scale along equator in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx (**-Ji**), or map width
   (**-JI**).

A simple world map using the sinusoidal projection is therefore obtained by

   ::

     gmt coast -Rd -JI4.5i -Bxg30 -Byg15 -Dc -A10000 -Ggray > GMT_sinusoidal.ps

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_sinusoidal.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   World map using the Sinusoidal projection.


To reduce distortion of shape the interrupted sinusoidal projection was
introduced in 1927. Here, three symmetrical segments are used to cover
the entire world. Traditionally, the interruptions are at 160ºW, 20ºW, and
60ºE. To make the interrupted map we must call
:doc:`coast` for each segment and superpose
the results. To produce an interrupted world map (with the traditional
boundaries just mentioned) that is 5.04 inches wide we use the scale
5.04/360 = 0.014 and offset the subsequent plots horizontally by their
widths (140\ :math:`\cdot`\ 0.014 and 80\ :math:`\cdot`\ 0.014):

   ::

     gmt begin GMT_sinus_int ps
     gmt coast -R200/340/-90/90 -Ji0.014i -Bxg30 -Byg15 -A10000 -Dc -Gblack
     gmt coast -R-20/60/-90/90 -Ji0.014i -Bxg30 -Byg15 -Dc -A10000 -Gblack -X1.96i
     gmt coast -R60/200/-90/90 -Ji0.014i -Bxg30 -Byg15 -Dc -A10000 -Gblack -X1.12i
     gmt end

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_sinus_int.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   World map using the Interrupted Sinusoidal projection.


The usefulness of the interrupted sinusoidal projection is basically
limited to display of global, discontinuous data distributions like
hydrocarbon and mineral resources, etc.

Van der Grinten projection (**-Jv** **-JV**) :ref:`... <-Jv_full>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Van der Grinten projection, presented by Alphons J. van der Grinten
in 1904, is neither equal-area nor conformal. Central meridian and
Equator are straight lines; other meridians are arcs of circles. The
scale is true along the Equator only. Its main use is to show the entire
world enclosed in a circle. To use it you must enter

-  The central meridian [Middle of your map].

-  Scale along equator in inch/degree or 1:xxxxx (**-Jv**), or map width (**-JV**).

Centered on the Dateline, the example below was created by this command:

GMT Supplemental Packages
=========================

These packages are for the most part written and supported by us, but
there are some exceptions. They provide extensions of GMT that are
needed for particular rather than general applications.
Questions or bug reports for this software
should be addressed to the person(s) listed in the ``README`` file associated with
the particular program. It is not guaranteed that these programs are
fully ANSI-C, Y2K, or POSIX compliant, or that they necessarily will
install smoothly on all platforms, but most do. Note that the data sets
some of these programs work on are not distributed with these packages;
they must be obtained separately. The contents of the supplemental
archive may change without notice; at this writing it contains these directories:

gshhg: GSHHG data extractor
---------------------------

This package contains :doc:`gshhg <supplements/gshhg/gshhg>` which you
can use to extract shoreline polygons from the Global Self-consistent
Hierarchical High-resolution Shorelines (GSHHG) available separately
from or the (GSHHG is the polygon data base from which the
GMT coastlines derive). The package is maintained by Paul Wessel.

img: gridded altimetry extractor
--------------------------------

This package consists of the program
:doc:`img2grd <supplements/img/img2grd>` to extract subsets of the

generates a 3-D plot (x and y: location coordinates, z: time/depth).
Locations may be read from predefined or arbitrary portions of each
trace header. Finally, :doc:`segy2grd <supplements/segy/segy2grd>` can
convert SEGY data to a GMT grid file. The package is maintained by Tim Henstock [28]_.

.. _App-file-formats:

GMT File Formats
================

Table data
----------

These files have *N* records which have *M* fields each. All programs
that handle tables can read multicolumn files. GMT can read both
ASCII, native binary, netCDF table data, and ESRI shapefiles (which
we convert to GMT/OGR format via GDAL's ogr2ogr tool under the hood).

ASCII tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optional file header records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first data record may be preceded by one or more header records. Any
records that begins with '#' is considered a header or comment line and
are always processed correctly. If your data file has leading header
records that do *not* start with '#' then you must make sure to use the
**-h** option and set the parameter :ref:`IO_N_HEADER_RECS <IO_N_HEADER_RECS>` in the :doc:`gmt.conf` file
(GMT default is one header record if **-h** is given; you may also use
**-h**\ *nrecs* directly). Alternatively, you can override the header record marker '#'
by modifying the :ref:`IO_HEADER_MARKER <IO_HEADER_MARKER>` default setting.
Fields within a record must be separated by
spaces, tabs, commas, or semi-colons. Each field can be an integer or floating-point
number or a geographic coordinate string using the
[±]dd[:mm[:ss]][W:\ \|\ S\ \|\ N\ \|\ E\ \|\ w\ \|\ s\ \|\ n\ \|\ e]
format. Thus, 12:30:44.5W, 17.5S, 1:00:05, and 200:45E are all valid
input strings. GMT is expected to handle most CVS (Comma-Separated Values)
files, including numbers given in double quotes.  On output, fields will be separated by the character
given by the parameter :ref:`IO_COL_SEPARATOR <IO_COL_SEPARATOR>`, which by default is a TAB.

Optional segment header records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When dealing with time- or (*x,y*)-series it is usually convenient to
have each profile in separate files. However, this may sometimes prove
impractical due to large numbers of profiles. An example is files of
digitized lineations where the number of individual features may range
into the thousands. One file per feature would in this case be
unreasonable and furthermore clog up the directory. GMT provides a
mechanism for keeping more than one profile in a file. Such files are
called *multiple segment files* and are identical to the ones just
outlined except that they have segment headers interspersed with data
records that signal the start of a new segment. The segment headers may
be of any format, but all must have the same character in the first
column. The unique character is by default '\ >\ ', but you can
override that by modifying the :ref:`IO_SEGMENT_MARKER <IO_SEGMENT_MARKER>` default setting.
Programs can examine the segment headers to see if they contain **-D**
for a distance value, **-W** and **-G** options for specifying pen and
fill attributes for individual segments, **-Z** to change color via a
CPT, **-L** for label specifications, or **-T** for general-purpose
text descriptions. These settings (and occasionally others) will
override the corresponding command line options. GMT also provides for
two special values for :ref:`IO_SEGMENT_MARKER <IO_SEGMENT_MARKER>` that can make
interoperability with other software packages easier. Choose the marker
**B** to have blank lines recognized as segment breaks, or use **N** to
have data records whose fields equal NaN mean segment breaks (e.g., as
used by Matlab or Octave). When these markers are used then no other
segment header will be considered. Note that :ref:`IO_SEGMENT_MARKER <IO_SEGMENT_MARKER>` can
be set differently for input and output.  Finally, if a segment represents
a closed polygon that is a hole inside another polygon you indicate this
with **-Ph**.  This setting will be read and processed if converting a
file to the OGR format.

Binary tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT programs also support native binary tables to speed up
input-output for i/o-intensive tasks like gridding and preprocessing.
This is discussed in more detail in section `Binary table i/o: The -b option`_.

NetCDF tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More and more programs are now producing binary data in the netCDF
format, and so GMT programs started to support tabular netCDF data
(files containing one or more 1-dimensional arrays) starting with
GMT version 4.3.0. Because of the meta data contained in those files,
reading them is much less complex than reading native binary tables, and
even than ASCII tables. GMT programs will read as many 1-dimensional
columns as are needed by the program, starting with the first
1-dimensional it can find in the file. To specifically specify which
variables are to be read, append the suffix
**?**\ *var1*\ **/**\ *var2*\ **/**\ *...* to the netCDF file name or
add the option **-bic**\ *var1*\ **/**\ *var2*\ **/**\ *...*, where
*var1*, *var2*, etc.are the names of the variables to be processed. The
latter option is particularly practical when more than one file is read:
the **-bic** option will apply to all files. Currently, GMT only
reads, but does not write, netCDF tabular data.

Shapefiles
~~~~~~~~~~

GMT programs that read tables also support ESRI shapefiles, provided GMT was compiled
with GDAL support.  By default, only the geographic coordinates are read.  To select
some or all aspatial fields, see the :ref:`\ **-a** option <-aspatial_full>`

Grid files
----------

GMT allows numerous grid formats to be read. In addition to the default
netCDF format it can use binary floating points, short integers, bytes, and
bits, as well as 8-bit Sun raster files (colormap ignored).  Additional
formats may be used by supplying read/write functions and linking these with
the GMT libraries. The source file ``gmt_customio.c`` has the information
that programmers will need to augment GMT to read custom grid files. See
Section `Grid file format specifications`_ for more information.

NetCDF files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, GMT stores 2-D grids as COARDS-compliant netCDF files.
COARDS (which stands for Cooperative Ocean/Atmosphere Research Data
Service) is a convention used by many agencies distributing gridded data
for ocean and atmosphere research. Sticking to this convention allows
GMT to read gridded data provided by other institutes and other
programs. Conversely, other general domain programs will be able to read
grids created by GMT. COARDS is a subset of a more extensive
convention for netCDF data called CF-1.5 (Climate and Forecast, version
1.5). Hence, GMT grids are also automatically CF-1.5-compliant.
However, since CF-1.5 has more general application than COARDS, not all
CF-1.5 compliant netCDF files can be read by GMT.

The netCDF grid file in GMT has several attributes (See Table
:ref:`netcdf-format <tbl-netcdf-format>`) to describe the content. The routine
that deals with netCDF grid files is sufficiently flexible so that grid files
slightly deviating from the standards used by GMT can also be read.

+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

By default, the first 2-dimensional variable in a netCDF file will be read as
the *z* variable and the coordinate axes *x* and *y* will be determined from
the dimensions of the *z* variable. GMT will recognize whether the *y*
(latitude) variable increases or decreases. Both forms of data storage are
handled appropriately.

For more information on the use of COARDS-compliant netCDF files, and on how
to load multi-dimensional grids, read Section `Modifiers for COARDS-compliant netCDF files`_.

Chunking and compression with netCDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT supports reading and writing of netCDF-4 files since release 5.0.  For
performance reasons with ever-increasing grid sizes, the default output format
of GMT is netCDF-4 with chunking enabled for grids with more than 16384 cells.
Chunking means that the data are not stored sequentially in rows along latitude
but rather split up into tiles.  Figure :ref:`netcdf_chunking` illustrates
the layout in a chunked netCDF file.  To access a subset of the data (e.g.,
the four blue tiles in the lower left), netCDF only reads those tiles
("chunks") instead of extracting data from long rows.

.. _netcdf_chunking:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_chunking.*
   :align: center

   Grid split into 3 by 3 chunks

Gridded datasets in the earth sciences usually exhibit a strong spatial
dependence (e.g. topography, potential fields, illustrated by blue and white
cells in Figure :ref:`netcdf_chunking`) and deflation can greatly reduce the
file size and hence the file access time (deflating/inflating is faster than
hard disk I/O).  It is therefore convenient to deflate grids with spatial
dependence (levels 1--3 give the best speed/size-tradeoff).

You may control the size of the chunks of data and compression with the
configuration parameters :ref:`IO_NC4_CHUNK_SIZE <IO_NC4_CHUNK_SIZE>`
and :ref:`IO_NC 4_DEFLATION_LEVEL <IO_NC4_DEFLATION_LEVEL>` as specified in
:doc:`gmt.conf` and you can check the netCDF format with :doc:`grdinfo`.

Classic netCDF files were the *de facto* standard until netCDF 4.0 was released
in 2008.  Most programs supporting netCDF by now are using the netCDF-4
library and are thus capable of reading netCDF files generated with GMT 5,
this includes official GMT releases since revision 4.5.8.  In rare occasions,
when you have to load netCDF files with old software, you may be forced to
export your grids in the old classic format.  This can be achieved by setting
:ref:`IO_NC4_CHUNK_SIZE <IO_NC4_CHUNK_SIZE>` to **c**\ lassic.

Gridline and Pixel node registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scanline format means that the data are stored in rows (*y* = constant)
going from the "top" (:math:`y = y_{max}` (north)) to the "bottom"
(:math:`y = y_{min}` (south)). Data within each row are ordered from
"left" (:math:`x = x_{min}` (west)) to "right" (:math:`x = x_{max}`
(east)). The *registration* signals how the nodes are laid out. The grid
is always defined as the intersections of all
*x* ( :math:`x = x_{min}, x_{min} + x_{inc}, x_{min} + 2 \cdot x_{inc}, \ldots, x_{max}` )
and *y* ( :math:`y = y_{min}, y_{min} + y_{inc}, y_{min} + 2 \cdot y_{inc}, \ldots, y_{max}` )
lines. The two scenarios differ as to which area each data point
represents. The default node registration in GMT is gridline node
registration. Most programs can handle both types, and for some programs
like :doc:`grdimage` a pixel registered file
makes more sense. Utility programs like
:doc:`grdsample` and
:doc:`grdproject` will allow you to
convert from one format to the other;
:doc:`grdedit` can make changes to the grid
header and convert a pixel- to a gridline-registered grid, or *vice
versa*. The grid registration is determined by the common GMT **-r**
option (see Section `Grid registration: The -r option`_).

Boundary Conditions for operations on grids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT has the option to specify boundary conditions in some programs
that operate on grids (e.g.,
:doc:`grdsample`, :doc:`grdgradient`,
:doc:`grdtrack`, :doc:`nearneighbor`, and
:doc:`grdview`, to name a few. The desired
condition can be set with the common GMT option **-n**; see Section
`Grid interpolation parameters: The -n option`_. The boundary conditions come into play when
interpolating or computing derivatives near the limits of the region
covered by the grid. The *default* boundary conditions used are those
which are "natural" for the boundary of a minimum curvature
interpolating surface. If the user knows that the data are periodic in
*x* (and/or *y*), or that the data cover a sphere with *x*,\ *y*
representing *longitude*,\ *latitude*, then there are better choices for
the boundary conditions. Periodic conditions on *x* (and/or *y*) are
chosen by specifying *x* (and/or *y*) as the boundary condition flags;
global spherical cases are specified using the *g* (geographical) flag.
Behavior of these conditions is as follows:

Periodic
    conditions on *x* indicate that the data are periodic in the
    distance (:math:`x_{max} - x_{min}`) and thus repeat values after
    every :math:`N = (x_{max} - x_{min})/x_{inc}`. Note that this
    implies that in a grid-registered file the values in the first and
    last columns are equal, since these are located at
    :math:`x = x_{min}` and :math:`x = x_{max}`, and there are
    *N + 1* columns in the file. This is not the case in a
    pixel-registered file, where there are only *N* and the first
    and last columns are located at :math:`x_{min} + x_{inc}/2` and
    :math:`x_{max} - x_{inc}/2`. If *y* is periodic all the same
    holds for *y*.

Geographical
    conditions indicate the following:

    #. If :math:`(x_{max} - x_{min}) \geq 360` and also 180 modulo
       :math:`x_{inc} = 0` then a periodic condition is used on
       *x* with a period of 360; else a default condition is used
       on the *x* boundaries.

    #. If condition 1 is true and also :math:`y_{max} = 90` then a
       "north pole condition" is used at :math:`y_{max}`, else a default
       condition is used there.

    #. If condition 1 is true and also :math:`y_{min} = -90` then a
       "south pole condition" is used at :math:`y_{min}`, else a default
       condition is used there.

    "Pole conditions" use a 180º phase-shift of the data, requiring 180
    modulo :math:`x_{inc} = 0`.

Default
    boundary conditions are

    .. math:: \nabla^2 f = \frac{\partial}{\partial n} \nabla^2 f = 0

    on the boundary, where :math:`f(x, y)` is represented by the values
    in the grid file, and :math:`\partial/\partial n` is the derivative
    in the direction normal to a boundary, and

    .. math:: \nabla^2 = \left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\right)

    is the two-dimensional Laplacian operator.

Native binary grid files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The old-style native grid file format that was common in earlier version
of GMT is still supported, although the use of netCDF files is
strongly recommended. The file starts with a header of 892 bytes
containing a number of attributes defining the content. The
:doc:`grdedit` utility program will allow you
to edit parts of the header of an existing grid file. The attributes
listed in Table :ref:`grdheader <tbl-grdheader>` are contained within the header record
in the order given (except the *z*-array which is not part of the
header structure, but makes up the rest of the file). As this header was
designed long before 64-bit architectures became available, the jump
from the first three integers to the subsequent doubles in the structure
does not occur on a 16-byte alignment. While GMT handles the reading
of these structures correctly, enterprising programmers must take care
to read this header correctly (see our code for details).

Sun raster files
----------------

The Sun raster file format consists of a header followed by a series of
unsigned 1-byte integers that represents the bit-pattern. Bits are
scanline oriented, and each row must contain an even number of bytes.
The predefined 1-bit patterns in GMT have dimensions of 64 by 64, but
other sizes will be accepted when using the **-Gp|P** option. The Sun
header structure is outline in Table :ref:`sunheader <tbl-sunheader>`.

Numerous public-domain programs exist, such as **xv** and
**convert** (in the GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick package), that will translate between
various raster file formats such as tiff, gif, jpeg, and Sun raster.
Raster patterns may be created with GMT plotting tools by generating
PostScript plots that can be rasterized by ghostscript and
translated into the right raster format.

Including GMT Graphics into your Documents
==========================================


Now that you made some nice graphics with GMT, it is time to add them
to a document, an article, a report, your dissertation, a poster, a web
page, or a presentation. Of course, you could try the old-fashioned
scissors and glue stick. More likely, you want to incorporate your
graphics electronically into the document. Depending on the application,
the GMT PostScript file will need to be converted to Encapsulated
PostScript (EPS), Portable Document Format (PDF), or some raster
format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, or TIFF) in order to incorporate them into the
document.

-  When creating a document intended for printing (article,
   dissertation, or poster) it is best to preserve the scalable vector
   characteristics of the PostScript file. Many applications can
   directly incorporate PostScript in the form of EPS files. Modern
   programs will often allow the inclusion of PDF files. Either way, the
   sharpness of lines and fonts will be preserved and can be scaled up
   or down as required.

-  When the aim is to display the graphics on a computer screen or
   present it using a projector, it is wise to convert the
   PostScript into a raster format. Although applications like
   PowerPoint can do this for you, you can best take the
   conversion into your own hands for the best results.

A large number of questions to the GMT-Help mailing list are related to
these rendering issues, showing that something as seemingly
straightforward as incorporating a PostScript file into a document is
a far from trivial exercise. This Chapter will show how to include
GMT graphics into documents and how to achieve the best quality results.

Making GMT Encapsulated PostScript Files
------------------------------------------

GMT produces freeform PostScript files. Note that a freeform
PostScript file may contain special operators (such as
``Setpagedevice``) that is specific to printers (e.g., selection of
paper tray). Some previewers may not
understand these valid instructions and may fail to image the file.
Also, embedding freeform PostScript with such instructions in it into
a larger document can cause printing to fail. While you could choose
another viewer (we recommend **ghostview**) to view single plots
prepared by GMT, it is generally wiser to convert PostScript to EPS
output when you are creating a plot intended for inclusion into a larger
document. Some programs (and some publishers as well) do not allow the
use of instructions like ``Setpagedevice`` as part of embedded graphics.

An EPS file that is to be placed into another document needs to have
correct bounding box parameters. These are found in the
PostScript Document Comment %%BoundingBox. Applications that generate
EPS files should set these parameters correctly. Because GMT\ makes
the PostScript files on the fly, often with several overlays, it is
not possible to do so accurately. Therefore, if you need and EPS version
with a "tight" BoundingBox you need to post-process your
PostScript file. There are several ways in which this can be
accomplished.

-  Programs such as Adobe Illustrator, Aldus Freehand, and
   Corel Draw will allow you to edit the BoundingBox graphically.

-  A command-line alternative is to use freely-available program
   **epstool** from the makers of Aladdin ghostscript. Running

      ::

       epstool -c -b myplot.ps

   should give a tight BoundingBox; **epstool** assumes the plot is
   page size and not a huge poster.

-  Another option is to use **ps2epsi** which also comes with the
   ghostscript package. Running

      ::

       ps2epsi myplot.ps myplot.eps

   should also do the trick. The downside is that this program adds an
   "image" of the plot in the preamble of the EPS file, thus increasing
   the file size significantly. This image is a rough rendering of your
   PostScript graphics that some programs will show on screen while
   you are editing your document. This image is basically a placeholder
   for the PostScript graphics that will actually be printed.

-  However, the preferred option is to use the GMT utility
   :doc:`psconvert`. Its **-A** option will
   figure out the tightest BoundingBox, again using ghostscript in
   the background. For example, running

      ::

       gmt psconvert -A -Te myplot.ps

   will convert the PostScript file ``myplot.ps`` into an encapsulated
   PostScript file ``myplot.eps`` which is exactly cropped to the tightest possible
   BoundingBox.

If you do not want to modify your illustration but just include it in a
text document: many word processors (such as Microsoft Word  or Apple Pages) will let you include a
PostScript file that you may place but not edit. Newer versions of
those programs also allow you to include PDF versions of your graphics.
Except for Pages, you will not be able to view the EPS figure
on-screen, but it will print correctly.

Converting GMT PostScript to PDF or raster images
---------------------------------------------------

Since Adobe's PDF (Portable Document Format) seems to have become the
*de facto* standard for vector graphics, you are often well off
converting GMT produced PostScript files to PDF. Being both vector
formats (i.e., they basically describe all objects, text and graphics as
lines and curves), such conversion sounds awfully straightforward and
not worth a full section in this document. But experience has shown
differently, since most converters cut corners by using the same tool
(Aladdin's ghostscript) with basic default options that are not
devised to produce the best quality PDF files.

For some applications it is practical or even essential that you convert
your PostScript file into a raster format, such as GIF (Graphics
Interchange Format), TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), PNG (Portable
Network Graphics), or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group). A web
page is better served with a raster image that will immediately show on
a web browser, than with a PostScript file that needs to be downloaded
to view, despite the better printing quality of the PostScript image.
A less obvious reason to convert your image to a raster format is to
by-pass PowerPoint's rendering engine in case you want to embed
the image into a presentation.

The are a number of programs that will convert PostScript files to PDF
or raster formats, like Aladdin's **pstopdf**, pbmplus' **pstoimg**,
or GraphicsMagick's and ImageMagick's **convert**, most of which run ghostscript
behind the scenes. The same is true for viewers like **ghostview** and
Apple's **Preview**. So a lot of the times when people report that
their PostScript plot does not look right but prints fine, it is the
way ghostscript is used with its most basic settings that is to blame.

When converting or viewing PostScript goes awry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some notorious pitfalls with ghostscript (and other
rendering programs for that matter).

Rendering.
    When you are converting to a raster format, make sure you use a high
    enough resolution so that the pixels do not show when it is enlarged
    onto a screen or using a projector. The right choice of resolution
    depends on the application, but do not feel limited to the default
    72 dpi (dots-per-inch) that is offered by most converters.

Image compression.
    There are *lossy* and *non-lossy* compressions. A compression
    algorithm is called "lossy" when information is lost in the
    conversion: there is no way back to get the full original. The
    effect can be seen when there are sharp color transitions in your
    image: the edges will get blurry in order to allow a more efficient
    compression. JPEG uses a lossy compression, PNG is non-lossy, and
    TIFF generally does not use compression at all. We therefore
    recommend you convert to PNG if you need to rasterize your plot, and
    leave JPEG to photographs.

Embedded image compression.
    When your GMT plot includes objects produced by
    :doc:`grdimage`, :doc:`image` or
    :doc:`legend`, they are seen as
    "images". The default options of ghostscript will use a
    *lossy* compression (similar to JPEG) on those images when
    converting them to PDF objects. This can be avoided, however, by
    inhibiting the compression altogether, or using the non-lossy
    *flate* compression, similar to the one used in the old
    **compress** program. This compression is fully reversible, so
    that your image does not suffer any loss.

Auto-rotation.
    The ghostscript engine has the annoying habit to automatically
    rotate an image produced with portrait orientation (using the **-P**
    option) so that the height is always larger than the width. So if
    you have an image that was printed in portrait mode but happens to
    have a width larger than height (for example a global map), it would
    suddenly get rotated. Again, this function needs to be switched off.
    Apple's Preview uses the ghostscript engine and suffers
    from the same annoying habit. Oddly enough, ghostscript does
    not force landscape plots to be "horizontal".

Anti-aliasing.
    This is not something to worry about when converting to PDF, but
    certainly when producing raster images (discussed below).
    *Anti-aliasing* in this context means that the rendering tries to
    avoid *aliasing*, for example, sampling only the blacks in a
    black-and-white hachure. It does so by first oversampling the image
    and then using "gray-shades" when a target pixel is only partially
    white or black.

    Clearly, this can lead to some unwanted results. First, all edges
    and lines get blurry and second, the assumption of a white
    background causes the gray shades to stand out when transferring the
    image to background with a different color (like the popular
    sleep-inducing blue in PowerPoint presentations). A more
    surprising effect of anti-aliasing is that the seams between tiles
    that make up the land mask when using
    :doc:`coast` will become visible. The
    anti-aliasing somehow decides to blur the edges of all polygons,
    even when they are seamlessly connected to other polygons.

    It is therefore wise to overrule the default anti-aliasing option
    and over-sample the image yourself by choosing a higher resolution.

Including fonts.
    When you are producing print-ready copy to publishers, they will
    often (and justifiably) ask that you include all fonts in your PDF
    document. Again, ghostscript (and all converters relying on
    that engine) will not do so by default.

Using :doc:`psconvert`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The remedy to all the problems mentioned in the previous section is
readily available to you in the form of the GMT utility
:doc:`psconvert`. It is designed to provide
the best quality PDF and raster files using ghostscript as a
rendering engine. The program :doc:`psconvert` avoids anti-aliasing and
lossy compression techniques that are default to ghostscript and
includes the fonts into the resulting PDF file to ensure portability. By
default the fonts are rendered at 720 dots-per-inch in a PDF file and
images are sampled to 300 dpi, but that can be changed with the **-E**
option. Simply run

   ::

    gmt psconvert -A -P -Tf *.ps

to convert all PostScript files to PDF while cropping it to the
smallest possible BoundingBox. Or use the **-Tg** option to convert your
files to PNG.

The **-P** option of :doc:`psconvert` may
also come in handy. When you have *not* supplied the **-P** option in
your first GMT plot command, your plot will be in Landscape mode. That
means that the plot will be rotated 90º (anti-clockwise) to fit
on a Portrait mode page when coming out of the printer. The **-P**
option of :doc:`psconvert` will undo that
rotation, so that you do not have to do so within your document. This
will only affect Landscape plots; Portrait plots will not be rotated.
We should note that the **-A** option in :doc:`psconvert` has many modifiers
that can be used to control background color, framing, padding, and overall
scaling of the result.

Examples
--------

GMT graphics in LaTeX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add the graphics into a LaTeX document we use the
``\includegraphics`` command supplied by the package. In the preamble of
your LaTeX document you will need to include the line

   ::

     \usepackage{graphicx}

The inclusion of the graphics will probably be inside a floating figure
environment; something like this

   ::

     \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics{myplot}
        \caption{This is my first plot in \LaTeX.}
        \label{fig:myplot}
     \end{figure}

Note that the ``\includegraphics`` command does not require you to add
the suffix ``.pdf`` to the file name. If you run **pdflatex**, it will
look automatically for ``myplot.pdf``. If you run **latex**, it will use ``myplot.eps`` instead.

You can scale your plot using the options ``width=``, ``height=``, or
``scale=``. In addition, if your original graphics was produced in
Landscape mode (i.e., you did *not* use GMT's **-P** option: not
while plotting, nor in :doc:`psconvert`),
you will need to rotate the plot as well. For example,

   ::

     \includegraphics[angle=-90,width=0.8\textwidth]{myplot}

will rotate the image 90º clockwise and scale it such that its width
(after rotation) will be 80% of the width of the text column.

GMT graphics in **PowerPoint**

   PowerPoint's Format Picture dialogue to set scale and rotation.

In Figure :ref:`Rendered images <Rendering>` we have attempted to include
Example :ref:`example_20` into a PowerPoint presentation.
First the PostScript file was converted to PDF (using
:doc:`psconvert`), then loaded into
PowerPoint and the white background color was made transparent
using the formatting toolbar (shown on the left side of
Figure :ref:`Rendered images <Rendering>`). Clearly, when we let PowerPoint
do the rendering, we do not get the best result:

*  The anti-aliasing causes the tiles that make up the land to stand
   out. This is because the anti-aliasing algorithm blurs all edges,
   even when the tiles join seamlessly.

*  The background color was assumed to be white, hence the text is
   "smoothed" using gray shades. Instead, shades of blue which would be
   appropriate for the background we are using.

On the central column of Figure :ref:`Rendered images <Rendering>` we have
included PNG
versions of a portion of the same example. This shows the workings of
anti-aliasing and different resolutions. All samples were obtained with
**convert**. The one on the top uses all default settings, resulting
in an anti-aliased image at 72 dpi resolution (very much like the PDF
included directly into PowerPoint).

Just switching anti-aliasing off (middle) is clearly not an option
either. It is true that we got rid of the gray blurring and the seams
between the tiles, but without anti-aliasing the image becomes very
blocky. The solution is to render the image at a higher resolution
(e.g., 300 dpi) without anti-aliasing and then shrink the image to the
appropriate size (bottom of the central column in
Figure :ref:`Rendered images <Rendering>`). The scaling, rotation as well as
the selection
of the transparent color can be accomplished through the "Formatting"
tool bar and the "Format Picture" dialogue box of PowerPoint
(Figure :ref:`PowerPoint dialogue box <PowerPoint_dialogue>`), which can be
found by double clicking the
included image (or selecting and right-clicking or control-clicking on a
one-button mouse).

Predefined Bit and Hachure Patterns in GMT
==========================================


GMT provides 90 different bit and hachure patterns that can be
selected with the **-Gp** or **-GP** option in most plotting programs.
The left side of each image was created using **-Gp**, the right side
shows the inverted version using **-GP**. These patterns are reproduced
below at 300 dpi using the default black and white shades.

Chart of Octal Codes for Characters
===================================

The characters and their octal codes in the Standard and ISOLatin1
encoded fonts are shown in
Figure :ref:`Octal codes for Standard and ISO <Octal_codes_stand_iso>`. Light red areas signify
codes reserved for control characters. In order to use all the extended
characters (shown in the light green boxes) you need to set
:ref:`PS_CHAR_ENCODING <PS_CHAR_ENCODING>` to Standard+ or ISOLatin1+ in your :doc:`gmt.conf` file [29]_.

Figure :ref:`Octal codes for Symbol and ZapfDingbats <Octal_codes_symbol_zap>` below. The octal code
is obtained by appending the column value to the \\??
value, e.g., :math:`\partial` is \\266 in the Symbol
font. The euro currency symbol is \\240 in the Symbol
font and will print if your printer supports it (older printer's
firmware will not know about the euro).

PostScript Fonts Used by GMT
==============================

GMT uses the standard 35 fonts that come with most
PostScript laserwriters. If your printer does not support some of
these fonts, it will automatically substitute the default font (which is
usually Courier). The following is a list of the GMT fonts:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_G.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   The standard 35 PostScript fonts recognized by GMT.


For the special fonts Symbol (12) and ZapfDingbats (34), see the octal
charts in Chapter `Chart of Octal Codes for Characters`_. When specifying fonts in GMT, you can
either give the entire font name *or* just the font number listed in
this table. To change the fonts used in plotting basemap frames, see the
man page for :doc:`gmt.conf`. For direct
plotting of text-strings, see the man page for :doc:`text`.

.. _non-default-fonts:

Using non-default fonts with GMT
--------------------------------

To add additional fonts that you may have purchased or that are
available freely in the internet or at your institution, see the
instructions in the ``PSL_custom_fonts.txt`` under the ``share/postscriptlight`` directory and continue reading. GMT does
not read or process any font files and thus does not know anything about
installed fonts and their metrics. In order to use extra fonts in
GMT you need to specify the PostScript name of the relevant fonts in
the file ``PSL_custom_fonts.txt``. You can either edit the existing file distributed with
GMT to make the changes global or you can create a new file in the
current working directory, e.g.,

   ::

    LinBiolinumO      0.700    0
    LinLibertineOB    0.700    0

The format is a space delimited list of the PostScript font name, the
font height-point size-ratio, and a boolean variable that tells GMT to
re-encode the font (if set to zero). The latter has to be set to zero as
additional fonts will most likely not come in standard
PostScript encoding. GMT determines how tall typical annotations
might be from the font size ratio so that the vertical position of
labels and titles can be adjusted to a more uniform typesetting. Now,
you can set the GMT font parameters to your non-standard fonts:

   ::

    gmt set FONT              LinBiolinumO \
            FONT_TITLE        28p,LinLibertineOB \
            PS_CHAR_ENCODING  ISO-8859-1 \
            MAP_DEGREE_SYMBOL degree

After setting the encoding and the degree symbol, the configuration part
for GMT is finished and you can proceed to create GMT-maps as usual.
An example script is discussed in Example :ref:`example_31`.

Embedding fonts in PostScript and PDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have Type 1 fonts in PFA (Printer Font ASCII) format you can
embed them directly by copying them at the very top of your
PostScript file, before even the %!PS header comment. PFB (Printer
Font Binary), TrueType or OpenType fonts cannot be embedded in
PostScript directly and therefore have to be converted to PFA first.

However, you most likely will have to tell Ghostscript where to
find your custom fonts in order to convert your GMT PostScript plot
to PDF or an image with :doc:`psconvert`.
When you have used the correct PostScript names of the fonts in ``PSL_custom_fonts.txt`` you
only need to point the ``GS_FONTPATH`` environment variable to the
directory where the font files can be found and invoke
:doc:`psconvert` in the usual way. Likewise
you can specify Ghostscript's ``-sFONTPATH`` option on the
command line with ``C -sFONTPATH=/path/to/fontdir``. Ghostscript,
which is invoked by :doc:`psconvert`, does
not depend on file names. It will automatically find the relevant font
files by their PostScript names and embed and subset them in
PDF-files. This is quite convenient as the document can be displayed and
printed even on other computers when the font is not available locally.
There is no need to convert your fonts as Ghostscript can handle
all Type 1, TrueType and OpenType fonts. Note also, that you do not need
to edit Ghostscript's Fontmap.

If you do not want or cannot embed the fonts you can convert them to
outlines (shapes with fills) with Ghostscript in the following
way:

   ::

     gs -q -dNOCACHE -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -dNOPLATFONTS \
        -sDEVICE=ps2write -sFONTPATH="/path/to/fontdir" \
        -sOutputFile=mapWithOutlinedFonts.ps map.ps

Note, that this only works with the *ps2write* device. If you need
outlined fonts in PDF, create the PDF from the converted
PostScript file. Also, :doc:`psconvert`
cannot correctly crop Ghostscript converted PostScript files
anymore. Use Heiko Oberdiek's instead or crop with
:doc:`psconvert` **-A** **-Te** before (See Example :ref:`example_31`).

Character encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since PostScript itself does not support Unicode fonts,
Ghostscript will re-encode the fonts on the fly. You have to make
sure to set the correct :ref:`PS_CHAR_ENCODING <PS_CHAR_ENCODING>`
with :doc:`gmtset` and save your
script file with the same character encoding. Alternatively, you can
substitute all non ASCII characters with their corresponding octal
codes, e.g., \\265 instead of μ. Note, that PostScript fonts support
only a small range of glyphs and you may have to switch the
:ref:`PS_CHAR_ENCODING <PS_CHAR_ENCODING>` within your script.

.. _Color Space:

Color Space: The Final Frontier
===============================

In this Chapter, we are going to try to explain the relationship
between the RGB, CMYK, and HSV color systems so as to (hopefully) make
them more intuitive. GMT allows users to specify colors in CPTs
in either of these three systems. Interpolation between colors is
performed in either RGB or HSV, depending on the specification in the
CPT. Below, we will explain why this all matters.

RGB color system
----------------

Remember your (parents') first color television set? Likely it had three
little bright colored squares on it: red, green, and blue. And that is
exactly what each color on the tube is made of: varying levels of red,
green and blue light. Switch all of them off, *r=g=b=0*, then you
have black. All of them at maximum, *r=g=b=255*, creates white.
Your computer screen works the same way.

A mix of levels of red, green, and blue creates basically any color
imaginable. In GMT each color can be represented by the triplet
*r7g7b*. For example, 127/255/0 (half red, full
green, and no blue) creates a color called chartreuse. The color sliders
in the graphics program GIMP are an excellent way to experiment
with colors, since they show you in advance how moving one of the color
sliders will change the color. As Figure *(a)* of :ref:`Chartreuse in GIMP <GIMP>`
shows: increase
the red and you will get a more yellow color, while lowering the blue
level will turn it into brown.

.. _GIMP:

.. figure:: /_images/gimp-sliders+panel.png
   :height: 230 px
   :width: 775 px
   :align: center
   :scale: 75 %

   Chartreuse in GIMP. *(a)* Sliders indicate how the color is altered
   when changing the H, S, V, R, G, or B levels. *(b)* For a constant hue (here 90)
   value increases to the right and saturation increases up, so the pure
   color is on the top right.


Is chocolate your favorite color, but you do not know the RGB equivalent
values? Then look them up in Figure :ref:`RGB chart <RGBchart>` or type
``man gmtcolors`` for a full list. It's 210/105/30. But GMT makes it easy
on you: you can specify pen, fill, and palette colors by any of the more
than 500 unique colors found in that file.

Are you very web-savvy and work best with hexadecimal color codes as
they are used in HTML? Even that is allowed in GMT. Just start with a
hash mark (``#``) and follow with the 2 hexadecimal characters for red,
green, and blue. For example, you can use ``#79ff00`` for chartreuse,
``#D2691E`` for chocolate.

.. _RGBchart:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_RGBchart_a4.*
   :width: 700 px
   :align: center

   The 555 unique color names that can be used in GMT. Lower, upper, or mixed cases, as well as
   the british spelling of grey are allowed. A4, Letter, and Tabloid sized versions of this RGB chart can be
   found in the GMT documentation directory.


HSV color system
----------------

If you have played around with RGB color sliders, you will have noticed
that it is not intuitive to make a chosen color lighter or darker, more
saturated or more gray. It would involve changing three sliders. To make
it easier to manipulate colors in terms of lightness and saturation,
another coordinate system was invented: HSV (hue, saturation, value).
Those terms can be made clear best by looking at the color sliders in
Figure :ref:`Chartreuse in GIMP <GIMP>`\ *a*. Hue (running from 0 to 360) gives you the full
spectrum of saturated colors. Saturation (from 0 to 1, or 100%) tells
you how ‘full' your color is: reduce it to zero and you only have gray
scales. Value (from 0 to 1, or 100%) will bring you from black to a
fully saturated color. Note that "value" is not the same as "intensity",
or "lightness", used in other color geometries. "Brilliance" may be the
best alternative word to describe "value". Apple calls it as
"brightness", and hence refers to HSB for this color space.

Want more chartreuse or chocolate? You can specify them in GMT as
90-1-1 and 25-0.86-0.82, respectively.

The color cube
--------------

We are going to try to give you a geometric picture of color mixing in
RGB and HSV by means of a tour of the RGB cube depicted in
Figure :ref:`fig_ex11`. The geometric picture is most
helpful, we think, since HSV are not orthogonal coordinates and not
found from RGB by a simple algebraic transformation. So here goes: Look
at the cube face with black, red, magenta, and blue corners. This is the
*g* = 0 face. Orient the cube so that you are looking at this face
with black in the lower left corner. Now imagine a right-handed
cartesian (*rgb*) coordinate system with
origin at the black point; you are looking at the *g = 0* plane
with *r* increasing to your right, *g* increasing away from
you, and *b* increasing up. Keep this sense of (*rgb*) as you look at the cube.

Now tip the cube such that the black corner faces down and the white
corner up. When looking from the top, you can see the hue, contoured in
gray solid lines, running around in 360º counter-clockwise. It starts
with shades of red (0), then goes through green (120) and blue (240),
back to red.

On the three faces that are now on the lower side (with the white print)
one of (*rgb*) is equal to 0. These three
faces meet at the black corner, where *r = g = b = 0*. On these
three faces the colors are fully saturated: *s = 1*. The dashed
white lines indicate different levels of *v*, ranging from 0 to 1
with contours every 0.1.

On the upper three faces (with the black print), one of
(*rgb*) is equal to the maximum value. These
three faces meet at the white corner, where *r = g = b = 255*. On
these three faces value is at its maximum: *v = 1* (or 100%). The
dashed black lines indicate varying levels of saturation: *s*
ranges from 0 to 1 with contours every 0.1.

Now turn the cube around on its vertical axis (running from the black to
the white corner). Along the six edges that zigzag around the "equator",
both saturation and value are maximum, so *s = v = 1*. Twirling
the cube around and tracing the zigzag, you will visit six of the eight
corners of the cube, with changing hue (*h*): red (0), yellow
(60), green (120), cyan (180), blue (240), and magenta (300). Three of
these are the RGB colors; the other three are the CMY colors which are
the complement of RGB and are used in many color hardcopy devices (see
below). The only cube corners you did not visit on this path are the
black and white corners. They lie on the vertical axis where hue is
undefined and *r = g = b*. Any point on this axis is a shade of gray.

Let us call the points where *s = v = 1* (points along the RYGCBM
path described above) the "pure" colors. If we start at a pure color and
we want to whiten it, we can keep *h* constant and *v = 1*
while decreasing *s*; this will move us along one of the cube
faces toward the white point. If we start at a pure color and we want to
blacken it, we can keep *h* constant and *s = 1* while
decreasing *v*; this will move us along one of the cube faces
toward the black point. Any point in (*rgb*)
space which can be thought of as a mixture of pure color + white, or
pure color + black, is on a face of the cube.

The points in the interior of the cube are a little harder to describe.
The definition for *h* above works at all points in (non-gray)
(*rgb*) space, but so far we have only
looked at (*s*, *v*) on the cube faces, not inside it. At
interior points, none of (*rgb*) is equal to
either 0 or 255. Choose such a point, not on the gray axis. Now draw a
line through your point so that the line intersects the gray axis and
also intersects the RYGCBM path of edges somewhere. It is always
possible to construct this line, and all points on this line have the
same hue. This construction shows that any point in RGB space can be
thought of as a mixture of a pure color plus a shade of gray. If we move
along this line away from the gray axis toward the pure color, we are
"purifying" the color by "removing gray"; this move increases the
color's saturation. When we get to the point where we cannot remove any
more gray, at least one of (*rgb*) will have
become zero and the color is now fully saturated; *s = 1*.
Conversely, any point on the gray axis is completely undersaturated, so
that *s = 0* there. Now we see that the black point is special,
*s* is both 0 and 1 at the same time. In other words, at the black
point saturation in undefined (and so is hue). The convention is to use
*h = s = v = 0* at this point.

It remains to define value. To do so, try this: Take your point in RGB
space and construct a line through it so that this line goes through the
black point; produce this line from black past your point until it hits
a face on which *v = 1*. All points on this line have the same
hue. Note that this line and the line we made in the previous paragraph
are both contained in the plane whose hue is constant. These two lines
meet at some arbitrary angle which varies depending on which point you
chose. Thus HSV is not an orthogonal coordinate system. If the line you
made in the previous paragraph happened to touch the gray axis at the
black point, then these two lines are the same line, which is why the
black point is special. Now, the line we made in this paragraph
illustrates the following: If your chosen point is not already at the
end of the line, where *v = 1*, then it is possible to move along
the line in that direction so as to increase
(*rgb*) while keeping the same hue. The
effect this has on a color monitor is to make the color more
"brilliant", your hue will become "stronger"; if you are already on a
plane where at least one of (*rgb*) = 255,
then you cannot get a stronger version of the same hue. Thus, *v*
measures brilliance or strength. Note that it is not quite true to say
that *v* measures distance away from the black point, because
*v* is not equal to :math:`\sqrt{r^2 + g^2 + b^2}/255`.

Another representation of the HSV space is the color cone illustrated in
Figure :ref:`hsv_cone`.

   The HSV color space

Color interpolation
-------------------

From studying the RGB cube, we hope you will have understood that there
are different routes to follow between two colors, depending whether you
are in the RGB or HSV system. Suppose you would make an interpolation
between blue and red. In the RGB system you would follow a path
diagonally across a face of the cube, from 0/0/255 (blue) via 127/0/127
(purple) to 255/0/0 (red). In the HSV system, you would trace two edges,
from 240-1-1 (blue) via 300-1-1 (magenta) to 360-1-1 (red). That is even
assuming software would be smart enough to go the shorter route. More
likely, red will be recorded as 0-1-1, so hue will be interpolated the
other way around, reducing hue from 240 to 0, via cyan, green, and yellow.

Depending on the design of your CPT, you may want to have it
either way. By default, GMT interpolates in RGB space, even when the
original CPT is in the HSV system. However, when you add the
line ``#COLOR_MODEL=+HSV`` (with the leading ‘+' sign) in the header of
the CPT, GMT will not only read the color
representation as HSV values, but also interpolate colors in the HSV
system. That means that H, S, and V values are interpolated linearly
between two colors, instead of their respective R, G, and B values.

The top row in Figure :ref:`Interpolating colors <color_interpolate>`
illustrates two examples: a blue-white-red scale (the palette in
Chapter `Of Colors and Color Legends`_) interpolated in RGB and the palette interpolated in
HSV. The bottom row of the Figure demonstrates how things can go
terribly wrong when you do the interpolation in the other system.

.. _color_interpolate:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_color_interpolate.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   When interpolating colors, the color system matters. The polar palette on the left needs to
   be interpolated in RGB, otherwise hue will change between blue (240) and white (0). The rainbow
   palette should be interpolated in HSV, since only hue should change between magenta (300) and red (0).
   Diamonds indicate which colors are defined in the palettes; they are fixed, the rest is interpolated.


Artificial illumination
-----------------------

GMT uses the HSV system to achieve artificial illumination of colored
images (e.g., **-I** option in :doc:`grdimage`) by changing the saturation
*s* and value *v* coordinates of the color. When the intensity is zero
(flat illumination), the data are colored according to the CPT. If
the intensity is non-zero, the color is either lightened or darkened
depending on the illumination. The color is first converted to HSV (if
necessary) and then darkened by moving (*sv*) toward
(:ref:`COLOR_HSV_MIN_S <COLOR_HSV_MIN_S>`, :ref:`COLOR_HSV_MIN_V <COLOR_HSV_MIN_V>`)
if the intensity is negative, or lightened by sliding (*sv*) toward
(:ref:`COLOR_HSV_MAX_S <COLOR_HSV_MAX_S>`, :ref:`COLOR_HSV_MAX_V <COLOR_HSV_MAX_V>`)
if the illumination is positive. The extremes of the *s* and *v* are defined in the
:doc:`gmt.conf` file and are usually chosen so the corresponding points are nearly black
(*s = 1*, *v = 0*) and white (*s = 0*, *v = 1*).
The reason this works is that the HSV system allows movements in color
space which correspond more closely to what we mean by "tint" and
"shade"; an instruction like "add white" is easy in HSV and not so
obvious in RGB.

Thinking in RGB or HSV
----------------------

The RGB system is understandable because it is cartesian, and we all
learned cartesian coordinates in school. But it doesn't help us create a
tint or shade of a color; we cannot say, "We want orange, and a lighter
shade of orange, or a less vivid orange". With HSV we can do this, by
saying, "Orange must be between red and yellow, so its hue is about
*h = 30*; a less vivid orange has a lesser *s*, a darker
orange has a lesser *v*". On the other hand, the HSV system is a
peculiar geometric construction, more like a cone
(Figure :ref:`hsv_cone`). It is not an orthogonal coordinate system, and
it is not found by a matrix transformation of RGB; these make it
difficult in some cases too. Note that a move toward black or a move
toward white will change both *s* and *v*, in the general
case of an interior point in the cube. The HSV system also doesn't
behave well for very dark colors, where the gray point is near black and
the two lines we constructed above are almost parallel. If you are
trying to create nice colors for drawing chocolates, for example, you
may be better off guessing in RGB coordinates.

CMYK color system
-----------------

Finally, you can imagine that printers work in a different way: they mix
different paints to make a color. The more paint, the darker the color,
which is the reverse of adding more light. Also, mixing more colored
paints does not give you true black, so that means that you really need
four colors to do it right. Open up your color printer and you'll
probably find four cartridges: cyan, magenta, yellow (often these are
combined into one), and black. They form the CMYK system of colors, each
value running from 0 to 1 (or 100%). In GMT CMYK color coding can be
achieved using *c/m/y/k* quadruplets.

Obviously, there is no unique way to go from the 3-dimensional RGB
system to the 4-dimensional CMYK system. So, again, there is a lot of
hand waving applied in the transformation. Strikingly, CMYK actually
covers a smaller color space than RGB. We will not try to explain you
the details behind it, just know that there is a transformation needed
to go from the colors on your screen to the colors on your printer. It
might explain why what you see is not necessarily what you get. If you
are really concerned about how your color plots will show up in your PhD
thesis, for example, it might be worth trying to save and print all your
color plots using the CMYK system. Letting GMT do the conversion to
CMYK may avoid some nasty surprises when it comes down to printing. To
specify the color space of your PostScript file, set
:ref:`PS_COLOR_MODEL <PS_COLOR_MODEL>` in the :doc:`gmt.conf` file to RGB, HSV, or CMYK.


Filtering of Data in GMT
========================

The GMT programs :doc:`filter1d` (for
tables of data indexed to one independent variable) and
:doc:`grdfilter` (for data given as
2-dimensional grids) allow filtering of data by a moving-window process.
(To filter a grid by Fourier transform use
:doc:`grdfft`.) Both programs use an argument
**-F**\ <\ *type*\ ><\ *width*> to specify the
type of process and the window's width (in 1-D) or diameter (in 2-D).
(In :doc:`filter1d` the width is a length of
the time or space ordinate axis, while in
:doc:`grdfilter` it is the diameter of a
circular area whose distance unit is related to the grid mesh via the
**-D** option). If the process is a median, mode, or extreme value
estimator then the window output cannot be written as a convolution and
the filtering operation is not a linear operator. If the process is a
weighted average, as in the boxcar, cosine, and gaussian filter types,
then linear operator theory applies to the filtering process. These
three filters can be described as convolutions with an impulse response
function, and their transfer functions can be used to describe how they
alter components in the input as a function of wavelength.

Impulse responses are shown here for the boxcar, cosine, and gaussian
filters. Only the relative amplitudes of the filter weights shown; the
values in the center of the window have been fixed equal to 1 for ease
of plotting. In this way the same graph can serve to illustrate both the
1-D and 2-D impulse responses; in the 2-D case this plot is a
diametrical cross-section through the filter weights
(Figure :ref:`Impulse responses <Impulse_responses>`).

.. _Impulse_responses:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_J_1.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Impulse responses for GMT filters.


Although the impulse responses look the same in 1-D and 2-D, this is not
true of the transfer functions; in 1-D the transfer function is the
Fourier transform of the impulse response, while in 2-D it is the Hankel
transform of the impulse response. These are shown in Figures
:ref:`Transfer functions for 1D <GMT_1D_filters>` and
:ref:`2D <GMT_2D_filters>`,
respectively. Note that in 1-D the
boxcar transfer function has its first zero crossing at *f = 1*,
while in 2-D it is around :math:`f \sim 1.2`. The 1-D cosine transfer
function has its first zero crossing at *f = 2*; so a cosine
filter needs to be twice as wide as a boxcar filter in order to zero the
same lowest frequency. As a general rule, the cosine and gaussian
filters are "better" in the sense that they do not have the "side lobes"
(large-amplitude oscillations in the transfer function) that the boxcar
filter has. However, they are correspondingly "worse" in the sense that
they require more work (doubling the width to achieve the same cut-off wavelength).

.. _GMT_1D_filters:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_J_2.*
   :width: 500 px

   Transfer functions for 1-D GMT filters.


One of the nice things about the gaussian filter is that its transfer
functions are the same in 1-D and 2-D. Another nice property is that it
has no negative side lobes. There are many definitions of the gaussian
filter in the literature (see page 7 of Bracewell [30]_). We define
:math:`\sigma` equal to 1/6 of the filter width, and the impulse
response proportional to :math:`\exp[-0.5(t/\sigma)^2)`. With this
definition, the transfer function is :math:`\exp[-2(\pi\sigma f)^2]` and
the wavelength at which the transfer function equals 0.5 is about 5.34
:math:`\sigma`, or about 0.89 of the filter width.

The GMT High-Resolution Coastline Data
======================================

Starting with version 3.0, GMT use a completely new coastline database
and the :doc:`coast` utility was been
completely rewritten to handle the new file format. Many users have
asked us why it has taken so long for GMT to use a high-resolution
coastline database; after all, such data have been available in the
public domain for years. To answer such questions we will take you along
the road that starts with these public domain data sets and ends up with
the database used by GMT.

Selecting the right data
------------------------

There are two well-known public-domain data sets that could be used for
this purpose. Once is known as the World Data Bank II or CIA Data Bank
(WDB) and contains coastlines, lakes, political boundaries, and rivers.
The other, the World Vector Shoreline (WVS) only contains shorelines
between saltwater and land (i.e., no lakes). It turns out that the WVS
data is far superior to the WDB data as far as data quality goes, but as
noted it lacks lakes, not to mention rivers and borders. We decided to
use the WVS whenever possible and supplement it with WDB data. We got
these data over the Internet; they are also available on CD-ROM from the
National Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colorado [31]_.

Format required by GMT
----------------------

In order to paint continents or oceans it is necessary that the
coastline data be organized in polygons that may be filled. Simple line
segments can be used to draw the coastline, but for painting polygons
are required. Both the WVS and WDB data consists of unsorted line
segments: there is no information included that tells you which segments
belong to the same polygon (e.g., Australia should be one large
polygon). In addition, polygons enclosing land must be differentiated
from polygons enclosing lakes since they will need different paint.
Finally, we want :doc:`coast` to be
flexible enough that it can paint the land *or* the oceans *or* both. If
just land (or oceans) is selected we do not want to paint those areas
that are not land (or oceans) since previous plot programs may have
drawn in those areas. Thus, we will need to combine polygons into new
polygons that lend themselves to fill land (or oceans) only (Note that
older versions of :doc:`coast` always
painted lakes and wiped out whatever was plotted beneath).

The long and winding road
-------------------------

The WVS and WDB together represent more than 100 Mb of binary data and
something like 20 million data points. Hence, it becomes obvious that
any manipulation of these data must be automated. For instance, the
reasonable requirement that no coastline should cross another coastline
becomes a complicated processing step.

*  To begin, we first made sure that all data were "clean", i.e., that
   there were no outliers and bad points. We had to write several
   programs to ensure data consistency and remove "spikes" and bad
   points from the raw data. Also, crossing segments were automatically
   "trimmed" provided only a few points had to be deleted. A few hundred
   more complicated cases had to be examined semi-manually.

*  Programs were written to examine all the loose segments and determine
   which segments should be joined to produce polygons. Because not all
   segments joined exactly (there were non-zero gaps between some
   segments) we had to find all possible combinations and choose the
   simplest combinations. The WVS segments joined to produce more than
   200,000 polygons, the largest being the Africa-Eurasia polygon which
   has 1.4 million points. The WDB data resulted in a smaller data base
   (~25% of WVS).

*  We now needed to combine the WVS and WDB data bases. The main problem
   here is that we have duplicates of polygons: most of the features in
   WVS are also in WDB. However, because the resolution of the data
   differ it is nontrivial to figure out which polygons in WDB to
   include and which ones to ignore. We used two techniques to address
   this problem. First, we looked for crossovers between all possible
   pairs of polygons. Because of the crossover processing in step 1
   above we know that there are no remaining crossovers within WVS and
   WDB; thus any crossovers would be between WVS and WDB polygons.
   Crossovers could mean two things: (1) A slightly misplaced WDB
   polygon crosses a more accurate WVS polygon, both representing the
   same geographic feature, or (2) a misplaced WDB polygon (e.g., a
   small coastal lake) crosses the accurate WVS shoreline. We
   distinguished between these cases by comparing the area and centroid
   of the two polygons. In almost all cases it was obvious when we had
   duplicates; a few cases had to be checked manually. Second, on many
   occasions the WDB duplicate polygon did not cross its WVS counterpart
   but was either entirely inside or outside the WVS polygon. In those
   cases we relied on the area-centroid tests.

*  While the largest polygons were easy to identify by visual
   inspection, the majority remain unidentified. Since it is important
   to know whether a polygon is a continent or a small pond inside an
   island inside a lake we wrote programs that would determine the
   hierarchical level of each polygon. Here, level = 1 represents
   ocean/land boundaries, 2 is land/lakes borders, 3 is
   lakes/islands-in-lakes, and 4 is
   islands-in-lakes/ponds-in-islands-in-lakes. Level 4 was the highest
   level encountered in the data. To automatically determine the
   hierarchical levels we wrote programs that would compare all possible
   pairs of polygons and find how many polygons a given polygon was
   inside. Because of the size and number of the polygons such programs
   would typically run for 3 days on a Sparc-2 workstation.

*  Once we know what type a polygon is we can enforce a common
   "orientation" for all polygons. We arranged them so that when you
   move along a polygon from beginning to end, your left hand is
   pointing toward "land". At this step we also computed the area of all
   polygons since we would like the option to plot only features that
   are bigger than a minimum area to be specified by the user.

*  Obviously, if you need to make a map of Denmark then you do not want
   to read the entire 1.4 million points making up the Africa-Eurasia
   polygon. Furthermore, most plotting devices will not let you paint
   and fill a polygon of that size due to memory restrictions. Hence, we
   need to partition the polygons so that smaller subsets can be
   accessed rapidly. Likewise, if you want to plot a world map on a
   letter-size paper there is no need to plot 10 million data points as
   most of them will plot several times on the same pixel and the
   operation would take a very long time to complete. We chose to make 5
   versions on the database, corresponding to different resolutions. The
   decimation was carried out using the Douglas-Peucker (DP)
   line-reduction algorithm [32]_. We chose the cutoffs so that each
   subset was approximately 20% the size of the next higher resolution.
   The five resolutions are called **f**\ ull, **h**\ igh,
   **i**\ ntermediate, **l**\ ow, and **c**\ rude; they are accessed in
   :doc:`coast`, :doc:`gmtselect`, and
   :doc:`grdlandmask` with the **-D**
   option [33]_. For each of these 5 data sets (**f**, **h**, **i**,
   **l**, **c**) we specified an equidistant grid (1, 2, 5, 10, 20) and
   split all polygons into line-segments that each fit inside one of the
   many boxes defined by these grid lines. Thus, to paint the entire
   continent of Australia we instead paint many smaller polygons made up
   of these line segments and gridlines. Some book-keeping has to be
   done since we need to know which parent polygon these smaller pieces
   came from in order to prescribe the correct paint or ignore if the
   feature is smaller than the cutoff specified by the user. The
   resulting segment coordinates were then scaled to fit in short
   integer format to preserve precision and written in netCDF format for
   ultimate portability across hardware platforms [34]_.

*  While we are now back to a file of line-segments we are in a much
   better position to create smaller polygons for painting. Two problems
   must be overcome to correctly paint an area:

   -  We must be able to join line segments and grid cell borders into
      meaningful polygons; how we do this will depend on whether we want
      to paint the land or the oceans.

   -  We want to nest the polygons so that no paint falls on areas that
      are "wet" (or "dry"); e.g., if a grid cell completely on land
      contains a lake with a small island, we do not want to paint the
      lake and then draw the island, but paint the annulus or "donut"
      that is represented by the land and lake, and then plot the
      island.

   GMT uses a polygon-assembly routine that carries out these tasks on the fly.

The Five Resolutions
--------------------

We will demonstrate the power of the new database by starting with a
regional hemisphere map centered near Papua New Guinea and zoom in on a
specified point. The map regions will be specified in projected km from
the projection center, e.g., we may want the map to go from km to km in
the longitudinal and the latitudinal direction.
Also, as we zoom in on the projection center we want to draw the outline
of the next map region on the plot. To do that we use the **-D** option
in :doc:`basemap`.

The crude resolution (**-Dc**)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We begin with an azimuthal equidistant map of the hemisphere centered on
130\ |degree|\ 21'E, 0\ |degree|\ 12'S, which is slightly west of New Guinea, near the Strait of
Dampier. The edges of the map are all 9000 km true distance from the
projection center. At this scale (and for global maps) the crude
resolution data will usually be adequate to capture the main geographic
features. To avoid cluttering the map with insignificant detail we only
plot features (i.e., polygons) that exceed 500 km\ :sup:`2` in area.
Smaller features would only occupy a few pixels on the plot and make the
map look "dirty". We also add national borders to the plot. The crude
database is heavily decimated and simplified by the DP-routine: The
total file size of the coastlines, rivers, and borders database is only
283 kbytes. The plot is produced by the script:

  ::

    gmt set MAP_GRID_CROSS_SIZE_PRIMARY 0 MAP_ANNOT_OBLIQUE 22 MAP_ANNOT_MIN_SPACING 0.3i
    gmt coast -Rk-9000/9000/-9000/9000 -JE130.35/-0.2/3.5i -P -Dc -A500 \

Here, we use the :ref:`MAP_ANNOT_OBLIQUE <MAP_ANNOT_OBLIQUE>` bit flags to achieve horizontal
annotations and set :ref:`MAP_ANNOT_MIN_SPACING <MAP_ANNOT_MIN_SPACING>` to suppress some
longitudinal annotations near the S pole that otherwise would overprint.
The square box indicates the outline of the next map.

The low resolution (**-Dl**)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have now reduced the map area by zooming in on the map center. Now,
the edges of the map are all 2000 km true distance from the projection
center. At this scale we choose the low resolution data that faithfully
reproduce the dominant geographic features in the region. We cut back on
minor features less than 100 km\ :sup:`2` in area. We still add
national borders to the plot. The low database is less decimated and
simplified by the DP-routine: The total file size of the coastlines,
rivers, and borders combined grows to 907 kbytes; it is the default
resolution in GMT. The plot is generated by the script:

  ::

    gmt coast -Rk-2000/2000/-2000/2000 -JE130.35/-0.2/3.5i -P -Dl -A100 -Gburlywood \

   :align: center

   Map using the low resolution coastline data.


The intermediate resolution (**-Di**)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We continue to zoom in on the map center. In this map, the edges of the
map are all 500 km true distance from the projection center. We abandon
the low resolution data set as it would look too jagged at this scale
and instead employ the intermediate resolution data that faithfully
reproduce the dominant geographic features in the region. This time, we
ignore features less than 20 km\ :sup:`2` in area. Although the script
still asks for national borders none exist within our region. The
intermediate database is moderately decimated and simplified by the
DP-routine: The combined file size of the coastlines, rivers, and
borders now exceeds 3.35 Mbytes. The plot is generated by the script:

The high resolution (**-Dh**)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The relentless zooming continues! Now, the edges of the map are all 100
km true distance from the projection center. We step up to the high
resolution data set as it is needed to accurately portray the detailed
geographic features within the region. Because of the small scale we
only ignore features less than 1 km\ :sup:`2` in area. The high
resolution database has undergone minor decimation and simplification by
the DP-routine: The combined file size of the coastlines, rivers, and
borders now swells to 12.3 Mbytes. The map and the final outline box are
generated by these commands:

We now arrive at our final plot, which shows a detailed view of the
western side of the small island of Waigeo. The map area is
approximately 40 by 40 km. We call upon the full resolution data set to
portray the richness of geographic detail within this region; no
features are ignored. The full resolution has undergone no decimation
and it shows: The combined file size of the coastlines, rivers, and
borders totals a (once considered hefty) 55.9 Mbytes. Our final map is
reproduced by the single command:

We hope you will study these examples to enable you to make efficient
and wise use of this vast data set.


GMT on non-\ UNIX Platforms
===========================

Introduction
------------

While GMT was ported to non-\ UNIX systems such as Windows, it is
also true that one of the strengths of GMT lies its symbiotic
relationship with UNIX. We therefore recommend that GMT be installed
in a POSIX-compliant UNIX environment such as traditional
UNIX-systems, Linux, or Mac OS X. If abandoning your
non-\ UNIX operating system is not an option, consider one of these
solutions:

WINDOWS:
    Choose among these three possibilities:

    #. Install GMT under MinGW/MSYS (A collection of GNU utilities).

    #. Install GMT under Cygwin (A GNU port to Windows).

    #. Install GMT in Windows using Microsoft C/C++ or other
       compilers. Unlike the first two, this option will not provide you
       with any UNIX tools so you will be limited to what you can do
       with DOS batch files.

Cygwin and GMT
--------------

Because GMT works best in conjugation with UNIX tools we suggest you
install GMT using the Cygwin product from Cygnus (now assimilated by
Redhat, Inc.). This free version works on any Windows version and it
comes with both the Bourne Again shell **bash** and the **tcsh**.
You also have access to most standard GNU development tools such as
compilers and text processing tools (**awk**, **grep**, **sed**,
etc.). Note that executables prepared for Windows will also run under Cygwin.

Follow the instructions on the Cygwin page on how to install the
package; note you must explicitly add all the development tool packages
(e.g., **gcc** etc) as the basic installation does not include them by
default. Once you are up and running under Cygwin, you may install
GMT  the same way you do under any other UNIX platform; our wiki
has instructions for packages you need to install first.

Finally, from Cygwin's User Guide: By default, no Cygwin program can
allocate more than 384 MB of memory (program and data). You should not
need to change this default in most circumstances. However, if you need
to use more real or virtual memory in your machine you may add an entry
in either the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** (to change the limit for all
users) or **HKEY_CURRENT_USER** (for just the current user) section of
the registry. Add the DWORD value **heap_chunk_in_mb** and set it to
the desired memory limit in decimal Mb. It is preferred to do this in
Cygwin using the **regtool** program included in the Cygwin package.
(For more information about **regtool** or the other Cygwin utilities,
see the Section called Cygwin Utilities in Chapter 3 of the Cygwin's
User Guide or use the help option of each utility.) You should always be
careful when using **regtool** since damaging your system registry can
result in an unusable system. This example sets the local machine memory
limit to 1024 Mb:

   ::

    regtool -i set /HKLM/Software/Cygnus\ Solutions/Cygwin/heap_chunk_in_mb 1024
    regtool -v list /HKLM/Software/Cygnus\ Solutions/Cygwin

For more installation details see the general README file.

MINGW|MSYS and GMT
------------------

Though one can install GMT natively using CMake, the simplest way of installing
under MINGW|MSYS is to just install the Windows binaries and use them from
the msys bash shell. As simple as that. Furthermore, GMT programs launch
faster here than on Cygwin so this is the recommended way of running
GMT on Windows.


Of Colors and Color Legends
===========================

Built-in color palette tables (CPT)
-----------------------------------

Figures :ref:`CPTs a <CPT_files_a>`, :ref:`b <CPT_files_b>` and
:ref:`b <CPT_files_c>` show the ~60 built-in
color palettes, stored in so-called CPTs [35]_. The programs
:doc:`makecpt` and
:doc:`grd2cpt` are used to access these
master CPTs and translate/scale them to fit the user's range of
*z*-values. The top half of the color bars in the Figure shows the
original color scale, which can be either discrete or continuous, though
some (like **globe**) are a mix of the two. The bottom half the color
bar are built by using :doc:`makecpt`
**-T**-1/1/0.25, thus splitting the color scale into 8 discrete colors.

`cpt-city <http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/>`_ and
`Scientific Colour-Maps <http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php>`_.

Labeled and non-equidistant color legends
-----------------------------------------

The use of color legends has already been introduced in Examples
:ref:`2 <example_02>`, :ref:`16 <example_16>`, and :ref:`17 <example_17>`.
Things become a bit more
complicated when you want to label the legend with names for certain
intervals (like geological time periods in the example below). To
accomplish that, one should add a semi-colon and the label name at the
end of a line in the CPT and add the **-L** option to the
:doc:`colorbar` command that draws the color
legend. This option also makes all intervals in the legend of equal
length, even it the numerical values are not equally spaced.

Normally, the name labels are plotted at the lower end of the intervals.
But by adding a *gap* amount (even when zero) to the **-L** option, they
are centered. The example below also shows how to annotate ranges using
**-Li** (in which case no name labels should appear in the CPT),
and how to switch the color bar around (by using a negative length).

.. _App-custom_symbols:

Custom Plot Symbols
===================

Background
----------

The GMT tools :doc:`plot` and :doc:`plot3d` are capable of using custom
symbols as alternatives to the built-in, standard geometrical shapes
such as circles, triangles, and many others. One the command line, custom
symbols are selected via the **-Sk**\ *symbolname*\ [*size*] symbol
selection, where *symbolname* refers to a special symbol definition file
called ``symbolname.def`` that must be available via the standard GMT user paths. Several
custom symbols comes pre-configured with GMT (see
Figure :ref:`Custom symbols <Custom_symbols>`)

.. _Custom_symbols:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_N_1.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Custom plot symbols supported by GMT. Note that we only show
   the symbol outline and not any fill. These are all single-parameter symbols.
   Be aware that some symbols may have a hardwired fill or no-fill component,
   while others duplicate what is already available as standard built-in symbols.


You may find it convenient to examine some of these and use them as a
starting point for your own design; they can be found in GMT's
share/custom directory.

The macro language
------------------

To make your own custom plot symbol, you will need to design your own
\*.def files. This section defines the language used to build custom
symbols. You can place these definition files in your current directory
or in your ``~/.gmt`` user directory. When designing the symbol you are working
in a relative coordinate system centered on (0,0). This point will be
mapped to the actual location specified by your data coordinates.
Furthermore, your symbol should be constructed within the domain
:math:`{-\frac{1}{2},+\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2},+\frac{1}{2}}`, resulting
in a 1 by 1 relative canvas area. This 1 x 1 square will be scaled to your
actual symbol size when plotted.  However, there are no requirement that
all your design fit inside this domain.

Comment lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your definition file may have any number of comment lines, defined to
begin with the character #. These are skipped by GMT but provides a
mechanism for you to clarify what your symbol does.

Symbol variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple symbols, such as circles and triangles, only take a single
parameter: the symbol size, which is either given on the command line
(via **-Sk**) or as part of the input data. However, more complicated
symbols that involve angles, or conditional tests, may require more
parameters. If your custom symbol requires more than the implicit single size
parameter you must include the line

    **N**: *n_extra_parameters* [*types*]

before any other macro commands. It is an optional statement in that
*n_extra_parameters* will default to 0 unless explicitly set. By
default the extra parameters are considered to be quantities that should
be passed directly to the symbol machinery. However, you can use the
*types* argument to specify different types of parameters and thus single
out parameters for pre-processing. The available types are

  **a** Geographic azimuth (positive clockwise from north toward east). Parameters
  identified as azimuth will first be converted to map angle
  (positive counter-clockwise from horizontal) given the current
  map projection (or simply via 90-azimuth for Cartesian plots).
  We ensure the angles fall in the 0-360 range and any macro test can rely on this range.

  **l** Length, i.e., an additional length scale (in cm, inch, or point as
  per :ref:`PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT <PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT>`) in addition to the given symbol size.

  **o** Other, i.e., a numerical quantity to be passed to the custom symbol unchanged.

  **r** rotation angles (positive counter-clockwise from horizontal).
  We ensure the angles fall in the 0-360 range and any macro test can rely on this range.

  **s** String, i.e., a single column of text to be placed by the **l** command.
  Use octal \\040 to include spaces to ensure the text string remains a single word.

To use the extra parameters in your macro you address them as $1, $2, etc.  There
is no limit on how many parameters your symbol may use.

Macro commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The custom symbol language contains commands to rotate the relative
coordinate system, draw free-form polygons and lines, change the current
fill and/or pen, place text, and include basic geometric symbols as part of the
overall design (e.g., circles, triangles, etc.). The available commands
are listed in Table :ref:`custsymb <tbl-custsymb>`.  Note that all angles
in the arguments can be provided as variables while the remaining parameters
are constants.

+---------------+------------+----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

Note for **R**\: if an **a** is appended to the angle then :math:`\alpha` is considered
to be a map azimuth; otherwise it is a Cartesian map angle.  The **a** modifier
does not apply if the angle is given via a variable, in which case the type of angle
has already been specified via **N:** above and already converged before seen by **R**.
Finally, the **R** command can also be given the negative of a variable, e.g., -$2 to
undo a rotation, if necessary.

Symbol fill and outline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally, symbols, polygons and lines will be rendered using any
fill and outline options you have given on the command line, similarly to how
the regular built-in symbols behave. For **M**, **T**, and all the lower-case
symbol codes you may optionally append specific pens (with **-W**\ *pen*) and fills (with
**-G**\ *pen*).  These options will force the use of these settings and
ignore any pens and fills you may or may not have specified on the command line.
Passing **-G**- or **-W**- means a symbol or polygon will have no
fill or outline, respectively, regardless of what your command line settings are.
Unlike pen options on the command line, a pen setting inside the macro symbol
offers more control.  Here, pen width is a *dimension* and you can specify
it in three different ways: (1) Give a fixed pen width with trailing unit (e.g., **-W**\ 1p,red);
we then apply that pen exactly as it is regardless of the size of the symbol,
(2) give a normalized pen thickness in the 0-1 range (e.g., **-W**\ 0.02);
at run-time this thickness will be multiplied by the current symbol size to yield
the actual pen thickness, and (3) specify a variable pen thickness (e.g., **-W**\ $1,blue); we then
obtain the actual pen thickness from the data record at run-time.
Finally, you may indicate that a symbol or polygon should be filled using the color
of the current pen instead of the current fill; do this by specifying **-G+p**.
Likewise, you may indicate that an outline should be drawn with the color of the
current fill instead of the current pen; do this by appending **+g** to your
**-W** setting (which may also indicate pen thickness and texture).  E.g.,
**-W**\ 1p,-+g would mean "draw the outline with a 1p thick dashed pen but obtain
the color from the current fill".

Symbol substitution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom symbols that need to plot any of the standard geometric symbols
(i.e., those controlled by a single size) can make the symbol code a variable.  By specifying **?** instead
of the symbol codes **a**, **c**, **d**, **g**, **h**, **i**, **n**, **+**, **s**, **t**,
**x**, **-**, or **y** the actual symbol code is expected to be found at the end of
each data record.  Such custom symbols must be invoked with **-SK** rather than **-Sk**.

Text substitution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally, the **l** macro code will place a hard-wired text string.  However,
you can also obtain the entire string from your input file via a single symbol
variable **$t** that must be declared with type **s** (string).  The string will be taken
as all trialing text in your data record.  To select a single word from the trailing text
you just use $k, where k starts at 1 for the first word, regardless of how many numerical
columns that precede it.  For each word you plan to use you must add a type **s** above.
Words must be separated by one tab or space only.  To place the dollar sign $ itself you must
use octal \\044 so as to not confuse the parser with a symbol variable.
The string itself, if obtained from the symbol definition file,
may contain special codes that will be expanded given information from the current record.  You
can embed the codes %X or %Y to add the current longitude (or x) and latitude (or y) in
your label string. You may also use $n (*n* is 1, 2, etc.) to embed a numerical symbol variable as text.
It will be formatted according to :ref:`FORMAT_FLOAT_MAP <FORMAT_FLOAT_MAP>`,
unless you append the modifiers **+X** (format as longitude via :ref:`FORMAT_GEO_MAP <FORMAT_GEO_MAP>`),
**+Y** (format as latitude via :ref:`FORMAT_GEO_MAP <FORMAT_GEO_MAP>`), or **+T** (format as calendar time via
:ref:`FORMAT_DATE_MAP <FORMAT_DATE_MAP>` and :ref:`FORMAT_CLOCK_MAP <FORMAT_CLOCK_MAP>`.

Text alignment and font attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like the **Sl** symbol in :doc:`plot`, you can change the current
font by appending to **l** the modifier **+f**\ *font* [FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY] and change the text justification
by appending the modifier **+j**\ *justify* [CM]. Note: Here, the *font* specification
will only be considered for the font type and not its size (which is set separately by your *size*
argument) or color and outline (which are set separately by **-G** and **-W** arguments).
Finally, there are two ways to specify the font size.  If a fixed font size is given in points
(e.g,, 12p) then the text will be set at that size regardless of the symbol size specified in **-S**.
Without the trailing **p** we interpret the size as a relative size in the 0-1 range and the actual
font size will then scale with the symbol size, just like other symbol items.

Conditional statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two types of conditional statements in the macro language: A
simple condition preceding a single command, or a more elaborate
if-then-elseif-else construct. In any test you may use one (and only
one) of many logical operators, as listed in Table :ref:`custop <tbl-custop>`.

.. _tbl-custop:

+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

Above, *left* refers to one of your variable arguments (e.g., $1, $2) or any constant
(e.g. 45, 2c, 1i) on the left hand side of the operator.  On the right hand side of the
operator, *right* is either one of your other variables, or a constant, or a range indicated by
two colon-separated constants or variables (e.g., 10:50, $2:60, $3:$4, etc.).
You can also use $x and $y for tests involving the current point's longitude (or *x*) and
latitude (or *y*) values, respectively.  Note that any tests involving $x will not consider
the periodicity of longitudes.  Finally, $s can be used to access the current symbol size.
Note that symbol size internally is converted to inches so any test you write that compares
the size to a constant should use a constant with the appropriate unit appended (e.g., 2c).

Simple conditional test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simple if-test uses a one-line format, defined as

    **if** *left* *operator* *right* **then** *command*

where *left* must be one of the symbol parameters, specified as $1, $2,
$3, etc., or a constant. You must document what these additional parameters control. For
example, to plot a small cyan circle at (0.2, 0.3) with diameter 0.4
only if $2 exceeds 45 you would write

    ::

     if $2 > 45 then 0.2 0.3 0.4 c -Gcyan

Note that this form of the conditional test has no mechanism for an
**else** branch, but this can be accomplished by repeating the test but
reversing the logic for the second copy, e.g.,

    ::

     if $1 > 10 then 0 0 0.5 c -Gred
     if $1 <= 10 then 0 0 0.5 c -Gblue

or you may instead consider the complete conditional construct below.
Using a comparison between variables is similarly straightforward:

    ::

     if $2 > $3 then 0.2 0.3 0.4 c -Ggreen

Complete conditional test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The complete conditional test uses a multi-line format, such as

| **if** *left* *operator* *right* **then** {
|  <one or more lines with commands>
| } **elseif** *left* *operator* *right* **then** {
|  <one or more lines with commands>
| } **else** {
|  <one or more lines with commands>
| }

The **elseif** (one or more) and **else** branches are optional. Note
that the syntax is strictly enforced, meaning the opening brace must
appear after **then** with nothing following it, and the closing brace
must appear by itself with no other text, and that the **elseif** and
**else** statements must have both closing and opening braces on the
same line (and nothing else). If you need comments please add them as
separate lines.  You may nest tests as well (up to 10
levels deep), e.g.,

   ::

    if $1 > 45 then {
            if $2 [> 0:10 then 0 0 0.5 c -Gred
    } elseif $1 < 15 then {
            if $2 [> 0:10 then 0 0 0.5 c -Ggreen
    } else {
            if $2 [> 10:20 then {
                    0 0 M -W1p,blue
                    0.3 0.3 D
                    S
                    0.3 0.3 0.3 c -Gcyan
            }
    }


Annotation of Contours and "Quoted Lines"
=========================================

The GMT programs :doc:`grdcontour` (for
data given as 2-dimensional grids) and
:doc:`contour` (for *x,y,z* tables) allow
for contouring of data sets, while :doc:`plot`
and :doc:`plot3d` can plot lines based on *x,y*-
and *x,y,z*-tables, respectively. In both cases it may be necessary to
attach labels to these lines. Clever or optimal placements of labels is
a very difficult topic, and GMT provides several algorithms for this
placement as well as complete freedom in specifying the attributes of
the labels. Because of the richness of these choices we present this
Chapter which summarizes the various options and gives several examples
of their use.

Label Placement
---------------

While the previous GMT versions 1--3 allowed for a single algorithm
that determined where labels would be placed, GMT 4 allows for five
different algorithms. Furthermore, a new "symbol" option (**-Sq** for
"quoted line") has been added to :doc:`plot` and
:doc:`plot3d` and hence the new label placement
mechanisms apply to those programs as well. The contouring programs
expect the algorithm to be specified as arguments to **-G** while the
line plotting programs expect the same arguments to follow **-Sq**. The
information appended to these options is the same in both cases and is
of the form [**code**]\ *info*. The five algorithms correspond to the
five codes below (some codes will appear in both upper and lower case;
they share the same algorithm but differ in some other ways). In what
follows, the phrase "line segment" is taken to mean either a contour or
a line to be labeled. The codes are:

**d**:
    Full syntax is
    **d**\ *dist*\ [**c\ \|\ i\ \|\ p**][/\ *frac*].
    Place labels according to the distance measured along the projected
    line on the map. Append the unit you want to measure distances in
    [Default is taken from :ref:`PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT <PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT>`]. Starting at the
    beginning of a line, place labels every *dist* increment of distance
    along the line. To ensure that closed lines whose total length is
    less than *dist* get annotated, we may append *frac* which will
    place the first label at the distance *d = dist*
    :math:`\times` *frac* from the start of a closed line (and every
    *dist* thereafter). If not given, *frac* defaults to 0.25.

**D**:
    Full syntax is
    **D**\ *dist*\ [**d\ \|\ m\ \|\ s\ \|\ e\ \|\ f\ \|\ k\ \|\ M\ \|\ n**][/\ *frac*].
    This option is similar to **d** except the original data must be
    referred to geographic coordinates (and a map projection must have
    been chosen) and actual Earth [36]_ surface distances along the
    lines are considered. Append the unit you want to measure distances
    in; choose among arc **d**\ egree, **m**\ inute, and **s**\ econd,
    or m\ **e**\ ter [Default], **f**\ eet, **k**\ ilometer, statute
    **M**\ iles, or **n**\ autical miles. Other aspects are similar to
    code **d**.

**f**:
    Full syntax is
    **f**\ *fix.txt*\ [/*slop*\ [**c\ \|\ i\ \|\ p**]].
    Here, an ASCII file *fix.txt* is given which must contain records
    whose first two columns hold the coordinates of points along the
    lines at which locations the labels should be placed. Labels will
    only be placed if the coordinates match the line coordinates to
    within a distance of *slop* (append unit or we use
    :ref:`PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT <PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT>`). The default *slop* is zero, meaning only
    exact coordinate matches will do.

**l**:
    Full syntax is **l**\ *line1*\ [,\ *line2*\ [, ...]]. One or more
    straight line segments are specified separated by commas, and labels
    will be placed at the intersections between these lines and our line
    segments. Each *line* specification implies a *start* and *stop*
    point, each corresponding to a coordinate pair. These pairs can be
    regular coordinate pairs (i.e., longitude/latitude separated by a
    slash), or they can be two-character codes that refer to
    predetermined points relative to the map region. These codes are
    taken from the :doc:`text` justification keys
    [**L\ \|\ C\ \|\ R**][**B\ \|\ M\ \|\ T**]
    so that the first character determines the *x*-coordinate and
    the second determines the *y*-coordinate. In
    :doc:`grdcontour`, you can also use
    the two codes **Z+** and **Z-** as shorthands for the location of
    the grid's global maximum and minimum, respectively. For example,
    the *line* **LT**/**RB** is a diagonal from the upper left to the
    lower right map corner, while **Z-**/135W/15S is a line from the
    grid minimum to the point (135ºW, 15ºS).

**L**:
    Same as **l** except we will treat the lines given as great circle
    start/stop coordinates and fill in the points between before looking
    for intersections.  You must make sure not to give antipodal start and
    stop coordinates since the great circle path would be undefined.

**n**:
    Full syntax is
    **n**\ *number*\ [/*minlength*\ [**c\ \|\ i\ \|\ p**]].
    Place *number* of labels along each line regardless of total line
    length. The line is divided into *number* segments and the labels
    are placed at the centers of these segments. Optionally, you may
    give a *minlength* distance to ensure that no labels are placed
    closer than this distance to its neighbors.

**N**:
    Full syntax is
    **N**\ *number*\ [/*minlength*\ [**c\ \|\ i\ \|\ p**]].
    Similar to code **n** but here labels are placed at the ends of each
    segment (for *number* >= 2). A special case arises for
    *number = 1* when a single label will be placed according to
    the sign of *number*: -1 places one label justified at the
    start of the line, while +1 places one label justified at
    the end of the line.

**s**:
    Similar to **n** but splits input lines into a series of two-point
    line segments first.  The rest of the algorithm them operates on
    these sets of lines.  This code (and **S**) are specific to
    quoted lines.

**S**:
    Similar to **N** but with the modification described for **s**.

**x**:
    Full syntax is **x**\ *cross.d*. Here, an ASCII file *cross.d* is a
    multi-segment file whose lines will intersect our segment lines;
    labels will be placed at these intersections.

**X**:
    Same as **x** except we treat the lines given as great circle
    start/stop coordinates and fill in the points between before looking
    for intersections.

Only one algorithm can be specified at any given time.

Label Attributes
----------------

Determining where to place labels is half the battle. The other half is
to specify exactly what are the attributes of the labels. It turns out
that there are quite a few possible attributes that we may want to
control, hence understanding how to specify these attributes becomes
important. In the contouring programs, one or more attributes may be
appended to the **-A** option using the format +\ *code*\ [*args*\ ] for
each attribute, whereas for the line plotting programs these attributes
are appended to the **-Sq** option following a colon (:) that separates
the label codes from the placement algorithm. Several of the attributes
do not apply to contours so we start off with listing those that apply
universally. These codes are:

**+a**:
    Controls the angle of the label relative to the angle of the line.
    Append **n** for normal to the line, give a fixed *angle* measured
    counter-clockwise relative to the horizontal. or append **p** for
    parallel to the line [Default]. If using
    :doc:`grdcontour` the latter option
    you may further append **u** or **d** to get annotations whose upper
    edge always face the next higher or lower contour line.

**+c**:
    Surrounding each label is an imaginary label "textbox" which defines
    a region in which no segment lines should be visible. The initial
    box provides an exact fit to the enclosed text but clearance may be
    extended in both the horizontal and vertical directions (relative to
    the label baseline) by the given amounts. If these should be
    different amounts please separate them by a slash; otherwise the
    single value applies to both directions. Append the distance units
    of your choice (**c\ \|\ i\ \|\ m\ \|\ p**), or
    give % to indicate that the clearance should be this fixed
    percentage of the label font size in use. The default is 15%.

**+d**:
    Debug mode. This is useful when testing contour placement as it will
    draw the normally invisible helper lines and points in the label
    placement algorithms above.

**+e**:
    Delayed mode, to delay the plotting of the text as text clipping is set instead.

**+f**:
    Specifies the desired label font, including size or color. See
    :doc:`text` for font names or numbers.
    The default font is given by :ref:`FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY <FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY>`.

**+g**:
    Selects opaque rather than the default transparent text boxes. You
    may optionally append the color you want to fill the label boxes;
    the default is the same as :ref:`PS_PAGE_COLOR <PS_PAGE_COLOR>`.

**+j**:
    Selects the justification of the label relative to the placement
    points determined above. Normally this is center/mid justified
    (**CM** in :doc:`text` justification
    parlance) and this is indeed the default setting. Override by using
    this option and append another justification key code from
    [**L\ \|\ C\ \|\ R**\ ][**B\ \|\ M\ \|\ T**\ ].
    Note for curved text (**+v**) only vertical justification will be
    affected.

**+o**:
    Request a rounded, rectangular label box shape; the default is
    rectangular. This is only manifested if the box is filled or
    outlined, neither of which is implied by this option alone (see
    **+g** and **+p**). As this option only applies to straight text, it
    is ignored if **+v** is given.

**+p**:
    Selects the drawing of the label box outline; append your preferred
    *pen* unless you want the default GMT pen [0.25p,black].

**+r**:
    Do *not* place labels at points along the line whose local radius of
    curvature falls below the given threshold value. Append the radius
    unit of your choice (**c\ \|\ i\ \|\ p**) [Default is 0].

**+u**:
    Append the chosen *unit* to the label. Normally a space will
    separate the label and the unit. If you want to close this gap,
    append a *unit* that begins with a hyphen (-). If you are contouring
    with :doc:`grdcontour` and you specify
    this option without appending a unit, the unit will be taken from
    the *z*-unit attribute of the grid header.

**+v**:
    Place curved labels that follow the wiggles of the line segments.
    This is especially useful if the labels are long relative to the
    length-scale of the wiggles. The default places labels on an
    invisible straight line at the angle determined.

**+w**:
    The angle of the line at the point of straight label placement is
    calculated by a least-squares fit to the *width* closest points. If
    not specified, *width* defaults to 10.

**+=**:
    Similar in most regards to **+u** but applies instead to a label
    *prefix* which you must append.

For contours, the label will be the value of the contour (possibly
modified by **+u** or **+=**). However, for quoted lines other options apply:

**+l**:
    Append a fixed *label* that will be placed at all label locations.
    If the label contains spaces you must place it inside matching
    quotes.

**+L**:
    Append a code *flag* that will determine the label. Available codes
    are:

    **+Lh**:
        Take the label from the current multi-segment header (hence it
        is assumed that the input line segments are given in the
        multi-segment file format; if not we pick the single label from
        the file's header record). We first scan the header for an
        embedded **-L**\ *label* option; if none is found we instead use
        the first word following the segment marker [>].

    **+Ld**:
        Take the Cartesian plot distances along the line as the label;
        append **c\ \|\ i\ \|\ p** as the unit [Default is
        :ref:`PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT <PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT>`]. The label will be formatted according
        to the :ref:`FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT <FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT>` string, *unless* label placement
        was determined from map distances along the segment lines, in
        which case we determine the appropriate format from the distance
        value itself.

    **+LD**:
        Calculate actual Earth surface distances and use the distance at
        the label placement point as the label; append
        **d\ \|\ e\ \|\ f\ \|\ k\ \|\ m\ \|\ M\ \|\ n\ \|\ s**
        to specify the unit [If not given we default to **d**\ egrees,
        *unless* label placement was determined from map distances along
        the segment lines, in which case we use the same unit specified
        for that algorithm]. Requires a map projection to be used.

    **+Lf**:
        Use all text after the 2nd column in the fixed label location
        file *fix.txt* as labels. This choice obviously requires the
        fixed label location algorithm (code **f**) to be in effect.

    **+Ln**:
        Use the running number of the current multi-segment as label.

    **+LN**:
        Use a slash-separated combination of the current file number and
        the current multi-segment number as label.

    **+Lx**:
        As **h** but use the multi-segment headers in the *cross.d* file
        instead. This choice obviously requires the crossing segments
        location algorithm (code **x\ \|\ X**) to be in effect.

Examples of Contour Label Placement
-----------------------------------

We will demonstrate the use of these options with a few simple examples.
First, we will contour a subset of the global geoid data used in
Example :ref:`example_01`; the region selected encompasses the world's strongest
"geoid dipole": the Indian Low and the New Guinea High.

Equidistant labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our first example uses the default placement algorithm. Because of the
size of the map we request contour labels every 1.5 inches along the
lines:

    ::

     gmt coast -R50/160/-15/15 -JM5.3i -Gburlywood -Sazure -A500 -K -P > GMT_App_O_1.ps
     gmt grdcontour geoid.nc -J -O -B20f10 -BWSne -C10 -A20+f8p -Gd1.5i -S10 -T+lLH >> GMT_App_O_1.ps

As seen in Figure :ref:`Contour label 1 <Contour_label_1>`, the contours are
placed rather arbitrary. The string of contours for -40 to
60 align well but that is a fortuitous consequence of reaching
the 1.5 inch distance from the start at the bottom of the map.

.. _Contour_label_1:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_1.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Equidistant contour label placement with **-Gd**, the only algorithm
   available in previous GMT versions.


Fixed number of labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now exercise the option for specifying exactly how many labels each
contour line should have:

    ::

     gmt coast -R50/160/-15/15 -JM5.3i -Gburlywood -Sazure -A500 -K -P > GMT_App_O_2.ps
     gmt grdcontour geoid.nc -J -O -B20f10 -BWSne -C10 -A20+f8p -Gn1/1i -S10 -T+lLH >> GMT_App_O_2.ps

By selecting only one label per contour and requiring that labels only
be placed on contour lines whose length exceed 1 inch, we achieve the
effect shown in Figure :ref:`Contour label 2 <Contour_label_2>`.

.. _Contour_label_2:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_2.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Placing one label per contour that exceed 1 inch in length, centered on the segment with **-Gn**.


Prescribed label placements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, we specify four points where we would like contour labels to be
placed. Our points are not exactly on the contour lines so we give a
nonzero "slop" to be used in the distance calculations: The point on the
contour closest to our fixed points and within the given maximum
distance will host the label.

    ::

     cat << EOF > fix.txt
     80      -8.5
     55      -7.5
     102     0
     130     10.5
     EOF
     gmt coast -R50/160/-15/15 -JM5.3i -Gburlywood -Sazure -A500 -K -P > GMT_App_O_3.ps
     gmt grdcontour geoid.nc -J -O -B20f10 -BWSne -C10 -A20+d+f8p -Gffix.txt/0.1i -S10 -T+lLH >> GMT_App_O_3.ps

The angle of the label is evaluated from the contour line geometry, and
the final result is shown in Figure :ref:`Contour label 3 <Contour_label_3>`.
To aid in understanding the algorithm we chose to specify "debug" mode
(**+d**) which placed a small circle at each of the fixed points.

.. _Contour_label_3:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_3.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Four labels are positioned on the points along the contours that are
   closest to the locations given in the file fix.txt in the **-Gf** option.


Label placement at simple line intersections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often, it will suffice to place contours at the imaginary intersections
between the contour lines and a well-placed straight line segment. The
**-Gl** or **-GL** algorithms work well in those cases:

    ::

      gmt coast -R50/160/-15/15 -JM5.3i -Gburlywood -Sazure -A500 -K -P > GMT_App_O_4.ps
      gmt grdcontour geoid.nc -J -O -B20f10 -BWSne -C10 -A20+d+f8p -GLZ-/Z+ -S10 -T+lLH >> GMT_App_O_4.ps

The obvious choice in this example is to specify a great circle between
the high and the low, thus placing all labels between these extrema.

.. _Contour_label_4:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_4.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Labels are placed at the intersections between contours and the great circle specified in the **-GL** option.


The thin debug line in Figure :ref:`Contour label 4 <Contour_label_4>` shows
the great circle and the intersections where labels are plotted. Note
that any number of such lines could be specified; here we are content
with just one.

Label placement at general line intersections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If (1) the number of intersecting straight line segments needed to pick
the desired label positions becomes too large to be given conveniently
on the command line, or (2) we have another data set or lines whose
intersections we wish to use, the general crossing algorithm makes more
sense:

    ::

     gmt coast -R50/160/-15/15 -JM5.3i -Gburlywood -Sazure -A500 -K -P > GMT_App_O_5.ps
     gmt grdcontour geoid.nc -J -O -B20f10 -BWSne -C10 -A20+d+f8p -GXcross.txt -S10 -T+lLH >> GMT_App_O_5.ps

.. _Contour_label_5:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_5.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Labels are placed at the intersections between contours and the
   multi-segment lines specified in the **-GX** option.


In this case, we have created three strands of lines whose intersections
with the contours define the label placements, presented in
Figure :ref:`Contour label 5 <Contour_label_5>`.

Examples of Label Attributes
----------------------------

We will now demonstrate some of the ways to play with the label
attributes. To do so we will use :doc:`plot` on
a great-circle line connecting the geoid extrema, along which we have
sampled the ETOPO5 relief data set. The file thus contains *lon, lat,
dist, geoid, relief*, with distances in km.

Label placement by along-track distances, 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example will change the orientation of labels from along-track to
across-track, and surrounds the labels with an opaque, outlined text box
so that the label is more readable. We choose the place the labels every
1000 km along the line and use that distance as the label. The labels
are placed normal to the line:

    ::

     gmt coast -R50/160/-15/15 -JM5.3i -Gburlywood -Sazure -A500 -K -P > GMT_App_O_6.ps
     gmt grdcontour geoid.nc -J -O -K -B20f10 -BWSne -C10 -A20+d+f8p -Gl50/10S/160/10S -S10 \
     -T+l"-+" >> GMT_App_O_6.ps
     gmt plot -R -J -O -SqD1000k:+g+LD+an+p -Wthick transect.txt >> GMT_App_O_6.ps

.. _Contour_label_6:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_O_6.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Labels attributes are controlled with the arguments to the **-Sq** option.


The composite illustration in Figure :ref:`Contour label 6 <Contour_label_6>`
shows the new effects. Note that the line connecting the extrema does
not end exactly at the ‘-' and ‘+' symbols. This is because the
placements of those symbols are based on the mean coordinates of the
contour and not the locations of the (local or global) extrema.

Label placement by along-track distances, 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A small variation on this theme is to place the labels parallel to the
line, use spherical degrees for placement, append the degree symbol as a
unit for the labels, choose a rounded rectangular text box, and
inverse-video the label:

    ::

     gmt coast -R50/160/-15/15 -JM5.3i -Gburlywood -Sazure -A500 -K -P > GMT_App_O_7.ps
     gmt grdcontour geoid.nc -J -O -K -B20f10 -BWSne -C10 -A20+d+u" m"+f8p -Gl50/10S/160/10S -S10 \

     gmt plot -R -J -O -SqD15d:+gblack+fwhite+Ld+o+u@. -Wthick transect.txt >> GMT_App_O_7.ps

The output is presented as Figure :ref:`Contour label 7 <Contour_label_7>`.

   Another label attribute example.


Using a different data set for labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the next example we will use the bathymetry values along the transect
as our label, with placement determined by the distance along track. We
choose to place labels every 1500 km. To do this we need to pull out
those records whose distances are multiples of 1500 km and create a
"fixed points" file that can be used to place labels and specify the
labels. This is done with **awk**.

    ::

     gmt convert -i0,1,4 -Em150 transect.txt | $AWK '{print $1,$2,int($3)}' > fix2.txt
     gmt coast -R50/160/-15/15 -JM5.3i -Gburlywood -Sazure -A500 -K -P > GMT_App_O_8.ps

     gmt plot -R -J -O -Sqffix2.txt:+g+an+p+Lf+u" m"+f8p -Wthick transect.txt >> GMT_App_O_8.ps

The output is presented as Figure :ref:`Contour label 8 <Contour_label_8>`.

Putting it all together
-----------------------

Finally, we will make a more complex composite illustration that uses
several of the label placement and label attribute settings discussed in
the previous sections. We make a map showing the tsunami travel times
(in hours) from a hypothetical catastrophic landslide in the Canary
Islands [37]_. We lay down a color map based on the travel times and the
shape of the seafloor, and travel time contours with curved labels as
well as a few quoted lines. The final script is

Special Operations
==================

.. _Isolation mode:

Running GMT in *isolation mode*
-------------------------------

In Chapter `General features`_ it is described how GMT creates
several (temporary) files to communicate between the different commands
that make up the script that finally creates a plot. Among those files
are:

    **gmt.conf** This file covers about 150 different settings that influence the
       layout of your plot, from font sizes to tick lengths and date
       formats (See Section `GMT defaults`_). Those settings can be altered
       by editing the file, or by running the
       :doc:`gmtset` command. A problem may arise
       when those settings are changed half-way through the script: the
       next time you run the script it will start with the modified
       settings and hence might alter your scripts results. It is therefore
       often necessary to revert to the original ``gmt.conf`` file. *Isolation mode*
       avoids that issue.

    **gmt.history** This file is created to communicate the command line history from
       one command to the next (Section `Command line history`_) so that
       shorthands like **-R** or **-J** can be used once it has been set in
       a previous GMT command. The existence of this file makes if
       impossible to run two GMT scripts simultaneously in the same
       directory, since those ``gmt.history`` files may clash (contain different histories)
       and adversely affect the results of both scripts.

A cure to all these woes is the *isolation mode* introduced in
GMT version 4.2.2. This mode allows you to run a GMT script without
leaving any traces other than the resulting PostScript  or data files,
and not altering the ``gmt.conf`` or ``gmt.history`` files. Those files will be placed in a temporary
directory instead. And if properly set up, this temporary directory will
only be used by a single script, even if another GMT script is running
simultaneously. This also provides the opportunity to create any other
temporary files that the script might create in the same directory.

The example below shows how *isolation mode* works.

    ::

     ps=GMT_App_P_1.ps

     # Create a temporary directory. $GMT_TMPDIR will be set to its pathname.
     # XXXXXX is replaced by a unique random combination of characters.
     export GMT_TMPDIR=`mktemp -d /tmp/gmt.XXXXXX`

     # These settings will be local to this script only since it writes to
     # $GMT_TMPDIR/gmt.conf
     gmt set COLOR_MODEL rgb FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY 14p

     # Make grid file and color map in temporary directory
     gmt grdmath -Rd -I1 Y = $GMT_TMPDIR/lat.nc
     gmt makecpt -Crainbow -T-90/90/180 -Z > $GMT_TMPDIR/lat.cpt

     # The gmt grdimage command creates the history file $GMT_TMPDIR/gmt.history
     gmt grdimage $GMT_TMPDIR/lat.nc -JK6.5i -C$GMT_TMPDIR/lat.cpt -P -K -nl > $ps
     gmt coast -R -J -O -Dc -A5000 -Gwhite -Bx60g30 -By30g30 >> $ps

     # Clean up all temporary files and the temporary directory
     rm -rf $GMT_TMPDIR

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_App_P_2.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Example created in isolation mode


The files ``gmt.conf`` and ``gmt.history`` are automatically created in the temporary directory
``$GMT_TMPDIR``. The script is also adjusted such that the temporary grid file ``lat.nc`` and colormap
``lat.cpt`` are created in that directory as well. To make things even more easy,
GMT now provides a set of handy shell functions in :doc:`gmt_shell_functions.sh`:
simply include that file in the script and the creation and the removal
of the temporary directory is reduced to the single commands **gmt_init_tmpdir** and
**gmt_remove_tmpdir**, respectively.

.. _OGR_compat:

The GMT Vector Data Format for OGR Compatibility
================================================

Background
----------

The National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New
Zealand has funded the implementation of a GMT driver (read and write)
for the OGR package. OGR is an Open Source toolkit for accessing or
reformatting vector (spatial) data stored in a variety of formats and is
part of the. The intention was to enable the easy rendering (using
GMT) of spatial data held in non-\ GMT formats, and the export of
vector data (e.g., contours) created by GMT for use with other GIS and
mapping packages. While **ogr2ogr** has had the capability to write
this new format since 2009, GMT 4 did not have the capability to use
the extra information.

GMT now allows for more advanced vector data, including donut
polygons (polygons with holes) and aspatial attribute data. At the same
time, the spatial data implementation will not disrupt older GMT 4
programs since all the new information are written via comments.

The identification of spatial feature types in GMT files generally
follows the technical description, (which is largely consistent with the
OGC SFS specification). This specification provides for non-topological
point, line and polygon (area) features, as well as multipoint,
multiline and multipolygon features, and was written by
`Brent Wood <http://www.niwa.co.nz/key-contacts/brent-wood/>`_
based on input from Paul Wessel and others on the GMT team.

The OGR/GMT format
------------------

Several key properties of the OGR/GMT format is summarized below:

-  All new data fields are stored as comment lines, i.e., in lines
   starting with a "#". OGR/GMT files are therefore compatible with
   GMT 4 binaries, which will simply ignore this new information.

-  To be consistent with current practice in GMT, data fields are
   represented as whitespace-separated strings within the comments, each
   identified by the "@" character as a prefix, followed by a single
   character identifying the content of the field. To avoid confusion
   between words and strings, the word (field) separator within strings
   will be the "\|" (pipe or vertical bar) character.

-  Standard UNIX "\\" escaping is used, such as \\n for newline in a string.

-  All new data are stored before the spatial data (coordinates) in the
   file, so when any GMT program is processing the coordinate data
   for a feature, it will already have parsed any non-spatial
   information for each feature, which may impact on how the spatial
   data is treated (e.g., utilizing the aspatial attribute data for a
   feature to control symbology).

-  The first comment line must specify the version of the OGR/GMT data
   format, to allow for future changes or enhancements to be supported
   by future GMT programs. This document describes v1.0.

-  For consistency with other GIS formats (such as shapefiles) the
   OGR/GMT format explicitly contains a field specifying whether the
   features are points, linestrings or polygons, or the "multi" versions
   of these. (Other shapefile feature types will not be supported at
   this stage). At present, GMT programs are informed of this via
   command line parameters. This will now be explicit in the data file,
   but does not preclude command line switches setting symbologies for
   plotting polygons as lines (perimeters) or with fills, as is
   currently the practice.

-  Note that what is currently called a "multiline" (multi-segment) file
   in GMT parlance is generally a set of "lines" in shapefile/OGR
   usage. A multiline in this context is a single feature comprising
   multiple lines. For example, all the transects from a particular
   survey may be stored as lines, each with it's own attribute set, such
   as transect number, date/time, etc. They may also be stored as a
   single multiline feature with one attribute set, such as trip ID.
   This difference is explicitly stored in the data in OGR/shapefiles,
   but currently specified only on the command line in GMT. This
   applies also to points and polygons. The GMT equivalent to
   {multipoint, multiline, multipolygon} datatypes is multiple
   GMT files, each comprising a single {multipoint, multiline,
   multipolygon} feature.

-  The new GMT vector data files includes a header comment specifying
   the type of spatial features it contains, as well as the description
   of the aspatial attribute data to be associated with each feature.
   Unlike the shapefile format, which stores the spatial and aspatial
   attribute data in separate files, the GMT format will store all
   data in a single file.

-  All the features in a GMT file must be of the same type.

OGR/GMT Metadata
----------------

Several pieces of metadata information must be present in the header of
the OGR/GMT file, followed by both spatial and aspatial data. In this
section we look at the metadata.

Format version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The comment header line will include a version identifier providing for
possible different versions in future. It is indicated by the **@V**
sequence.

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Code**  | **Argument**  | **Description**                                                    |
+===========+===============+====================================================================+
| V         | GMT1.0        | Data in this file is stored using v1.0 of the OGR/GMT data format  |
+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

An OGR/GMT file must therefore begin with the line

   ::

    # @VGMT1.0

Parsing of the OGR/GMT format is only activated if the version
code-sequence has been found.

Geometry types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The words and characters used to specify the geometry type (preceded by
the **@G** code sequence on the header comment line), are listed in
Table :ref:`geometries <tbl-geometries>`.

.. _tbl-geometries:

+----------+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Code** | **Geometry**    | **Description**                                                                       |

An example GMT polygon file header using this specification (in format 1.0) is

   ::

    # @VGMT1.0 @GPOLYGON

Domain and map projections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new format will also support region and projection information. The
region will be stored in GMT **-R** format (i.e., **-R**\ *W/E/S/N*,
where the *W/E/S/N* values represent the extent of features); the **@R**
code sequence marks the domain information. A sample region header is:

   ::

    # @R150/190/-45/-54

Projection information will be represented as four optional strings,
prefixed by **@J** (J being the GMT character for projection
information. The **@J** code will be followed by a character identifying
the format, as shown in Table :ref:`projectspec <tbl-projectspec>`.

.. _tbl-projectspec:

+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Code**   | **Projection Specification**                                                                    |
+============+=================================================================================================+
| @Je        | EPSG code for the projection                                                                    |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| @Jg        | A string representing the projection parameters as used by GMT                                  |

| @Jp        | A string comprising the Proj.4 parameters representing the projection parameters                |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| @Jw        | A string comprising the OGR WKT (well known text) representation of the projection parameters   |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Sample projection strings are:

   ::

    # @Je4326 @JgX @Jp"+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84+datum=WGS84 +no_defs"
    # @Jw"GEOGCS[\"WGS84\",DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",SPHEROID\"WGS84\",6378137,\
    298.257223563,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7030\"]],TOWGS84[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

    AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],UNIT[\"degree\",0.01745329251994328,\
    AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4326\"]]"

Note that an OGR-generated file will not have a **@Jg** string, as OGR
does not have any knowledge of the GMT projection specification
format. GMT supports at least one of the other formats to provide
interoperability with other Open Source related GIS software packages.
One relatively simple approach, (with some limitations), would be a
lookup table matching EPSG codes to GMT strings.

Declaration of aspatial fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The string describing the aspatial field names associated with the
features is flagged by the **@N** prefix.

+------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Code**   | **Argument**                | **Description**                                                 |
+============+=============================+=================================================================+
| N          | word\ \|\ word\ \|\ word    | A "\|" -separated string of names of the attribute field names  |
+------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

Any name containing a space must be quoted. The **@N** selection must be
combined with a matching string specifying the data type for each of the
named fields, using the **@T** prefix.

+------------+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Code**   | **Argument**                | **Description**                                             |
+============+=============================+=============================================================+
| T          | word\ \|\ word\ \|\ word    | A "\|" -separated string of the attribute field data types  |
+------------+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

Available datatypes should largely follow the shapefile (DB3)
specification, including **string**, **integer**, **double**,
**datetime**, and **logical** (boolean). In OGR/GMT vector files, they
will be stored as appropriately formatted text strings.

An example header record containing all these is

   ::

    # @VGMT1.0 @GPOLYGON @Nname|depth|id @Tstring|double|integer

OGR/GMT Data
------------

All generic fields must be at the start of the file before any
feature-specific content (feature attribute data follow the metadata, as
do the feature coordinates, separated by a comment line comprising "#
FEATURE_DATA". Provided each string is formatted as specified, and
occurs on a line prefixed with "#" (i.e., is a comment), the format is
free form, in that as many comment lines as desired may be used, with
one or more parameter strings in any order in any line. E.g., one
parameter per line, or all parameters on one line.

Embedding aspatial data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following this header line is the data itself, both aspatial and
spatial. For line and polygon (including multiline and multipolygon)
data, features are separated using a predefined character, by default
">". For point (and multipoint) data, no such separator is required. The
comment line containing the aspatial data for each feature will
immediately precede the coordinate line(s). Thus in the case of lines
and polygons, it will immediately follow the ">" line. The data line
will be a comment flag ("#") followed by **@D**, followed by a string of
"\|"-separated words comprising the data fields defined in the
header record.

To allow for names and values containing spaces, such string items among
the **@N** or **@D** specifiers must be enclosed in double quotes.
(Where double quotes or pipe characters are included in the string, they
must be escaped using "\\"). Where any data values are
null, they will be represented as no characters between the field
separator, (e.g., #@D\ \|\ \|\ \|). A Sample header
and corresponding data line for points are

   ::

    # @VGMT1.0 @GPOINT @Nname|depth|id @Tstring|double|integer
    # @D"Point 1"|-34.5|1

while for a polygon it may look like

   ::

    # @VGMT1.0 @GPOLYGON @Nname|depth|id @Tstring|double|integer
    >
    # @D"Area 1"|-34.5|1

Polygon topologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New to GMT is the concept of polygon holes. Most other formats do
support this structure, so that a polygon is specified as a sequence of
point defining the perimeter, optionally followed by similar coordinate
sequences defining any holes (the "donut" polygon concept).

To implement this in a way which is compatible with previous
GMT versions, each polygon feature must be able to be identified as
the outer perimeter, or an inner ring (hole). This is done using a
**@P** or **@H** on the data comment preceding the polygon coordinates.
The **@P** specifies a new feature boundary (perimeter), any following
**@H** polygons are holes, and must be within the preceding **@P**
polygon (as described in the shapefile specification). Any **@H**
polygons will NOT have any **@D** values, as the aspatial attribute data
pertain to the entire feature, the **@H** polygons are not new polygons,
but are merely a continuation of the definition of the same feature.
Note: The perimeter and the hole(s) must have different handedness.
E.g., if the perimeter goes counter-clockwise then the holes must go
clockwise, and vice versa.  This is important to follow if you are creating
such features manually.

Examples
--------

Sample point, line and polygon files are (the new data structures are in
lines starting with "#" in strings prefixed with "@"). Here is a typical
point file:

   ::

    # @VGMT1.0 @GPOINT @Nname|depth|id
    # @Tstring|double|integer
    # @R178.43/178.5/-57.98/-34.5
    # @Je4326
    # @Jp"+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84+no_defs"
    # FEATURE_DATA
    # @D"point 1"|-34.5|1
    178.5 -45.7
    # @D"Point 2"|-57.98|2
    178.43 -46.8
    ...

Next is an example of a line file:

   ::

    # @VGMT1.0 @GLINESTRING @Nname|depth|id
    # @Tstring|double|integer
    # @R178.1/178.6/-48.7/-45.6
    # @Jp"+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84+no_defs"
    # FEATURE_DATA
    > -W0.25p
    # @D"Line 1"|-50|1
    178.5 -45.7
    178.6 -48.2
    178.4 -48.7
    178.1 -45.6
    > -W0.25p
    # @D"Line 2"|-57.98|$
    178.43 -46.8
    ...

Finally we show an example of a polygon file:

   ::

    # @VGMT1.0 @GPOLYGON @N"Polygon name"|substrate|id @Tstring|string|integer
    # @R178.1/178.6/-48.7/-45.6
    # @Jj@Jp"+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84+no_defs"
    # FEATURE_DATA
    > -Gblue -W0.25p
    # @P
    # @D"Area 1"|finesand|1
    178.1 -45.6
    178.1 -48.2
    178.5 -48.2
    178.5 -45.6
    178.1 -45.6
    >
    # @H
    # First hole in the preceding perimeter, so is technically still
    # part of the same geometry, despite the preceding > character.
    # No attribute data is provided, as this is inherited.
    178.2 -45.4
    178.2 -46.5
    178.4 -46.5
    178.4 -45.4
    178.2 -45.4
    >
    # @P
    ...

   The Gregorian Calendar is a revision of the Julian Calendar which was
   instituted in a papal bull by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. The reason
   for the calendar change was to correct for drift in the dates of
   significant religious observations (primarily Easter) and to prevent
   further drift in the dates. The important effects of the change were
   (a) Drop 10 days from October 1582 to realign the Vernal Equinox with
   21 March, (b) change leap year selection so that not all years ending
   in "00" are leap years, and (c) change the beginning of the year to 1
   January from 25 March. Adoption of the new calendar was essentially
   immediate within Catholic countries. In the Protestant countries,
   where papal authority was neither recognized not appreciated,
   adoption came more slowly. England finally adopted the new calendar
   in 1752, with eleven days removed from September. The additional day
   came because the old and new calendars disagreed on whether 1700 was
   a leap year, so the Julian calendar had to be adjusted by one more
   day.
