Session One
===========

Tutorial setup
--------------

#. GMT man pages, documentation, and gallery example scripts are available from the GMT.jl documentation web page
   available from https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/GMTjl_doc/.

#. We recommend you create a sub-directory called *tutorial*,
   cd into that directory, and run the commands there to keep things tidy.

#. As we discuss GMT principles it may be a good idea to consult :doc:`the GMT Technical Reference </reference>`
   for more detailed explanations (but the Reference is not translated into the GMT.jl syntax).

#. The tutorial data sets are distributed via the GMT cache server.
   You will therefore find that all the data files have a "@" prepended to
   their names. This will ensure the file is copied from the server
   before being used, hence you do not need to download any of the
   data manually. The only downside is that you will need an Internet
   connection to run the examples by cut and paste.

#. Please cd into the directory *tutorial*. We are now ready to start.


Input data
~~~~~~~~~~

A GMT module may or may not take input data/files. Four different
types of input are recognized (more details can be found in :doc:`/reference/file-formats`):

#. Data tables.
   These are rectangular tables with a fixed number of columns and
   unlimited number of rows. We distinguish between two groups:

    * ASCII (Preferred unless files are huge)

    * Binary (to speed up input/output)

    * In memory GMTdataset or plain Julia matrices.

   Such tables may have segment headers and can therefore hold any number of
   subsets such as individual line segments or polygons.

#. Gridded dated sets.
   These are data matrices (evenly spaced in two coordinates) that come in two flavors:

    * Grid-line registration

    * Pixel registration

   You may choose among several file formats (even define your own format),
   but the GMT default is the architecture-independent netCDF format.

   The other alternative is to use Julia in-memory data in the form of GMTgrids.

#. Color palette table (For imaging, color plots, and contour maps). We will discuss these later.


Job Control
~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT modules may get operational parameters from several places:

#. Supplied command line options/switches or module defaults.

#. Short-hand notation to select previously used option arguments.

#. Implicitly using GMT defaults for a variety of parameters (stored in :doc:`/gmt.conf`).

#. May use hidden support data like coastlines or PostScript patterns.

Output data
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 5 general categories of output produced by GMT:

#. PostScript plot commands.

#. Data Table(s).

#. Gridded data set(s).

#. Statistics & Summaries.

#. Warnings and Errors, written to the REPL


Laboratory Exercises
--------------------

We will begin our adventure by making some simple plot axes and coastline basemaps. We will do this in order
to introduce the all-important common options **frame**, **proj**, and **region** and to familiarize ourselves
with a few selected GMT projections. The GMT modules we will utilize are :doc:`/basemap` and
`basemap <https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/GMTjl_doc/documentation/modules/coast/>`_.
Please consult their manual pages for reference.

Linear projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We start by making the basemap frame for a linear *x-y* plot. We want it to go from 10 to 70 in *x* and from
-3 to 8 in *y*, with automatic annotation intervals. Finally, we let the canvas be painted light red and have
dimensions of 10 by 7.5 centimeters. Here's how we do it:

   ::

    basemap(region=(10,70,-3,8), proj=:linear, figsize=(10,7.5),
            frame=(fill=:lightred, title="My first plot"), show=true)

This script will open the result in a PNG viewer and it should look like :ref:`our example 1 below <gmt_tut_1_jl>`.
Examine the :doc:`/basemap` documentation so you understand what each option means.

.. _gmt_tut_1_jl:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_1.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 1.

Exercises:

#. Try change the **proj=:linear** values.

#. Try change the **frame** values.

#. Change title and canvas color.


Logarithmic projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We next will show how to do a basemap for a logâ€“log plot. We have no data set yet but we will imagine that the
raw *x* data range from 3 to 9613 and that *y* ranges from 10\ :sup:`20` to 10\ :sup:`24`. One possibility is

   ::

    basemap(region=(1,10000,1e20,1e25), proj=:loglog, figsize=(12,8), xaxis=(annot=2, label="Wavelength (m)"),
            yaxis=(annot=1, ticks=3, scale=:pow, label="Power (W)"), frame=(axes=:WS,), show=true)

Make sure your plot looks like :ref:`our example 2 below <gmt_tut_2_jl>`

.. _gmt_tut_2_jl:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_2.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 2.

Exercises:

#. Do not use **proj**\ =:loglog the axes lengths.

#. Leave the **scale**\ =:pow out of the **frame** string.

#. Add **grid**\ =3 to **xaxis** and **yaxis** settings.

Mercator projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Despite the problems of extreme horizontal exaggeration at high latitudes, the conformal Mercator projection
(**proj=:merc**) remains the stalwart of location maps used by scientists. It is one of several cylindrical
projections offered by GMT; here we will only have time to focus on one such projection. The complete syntax is simply

**proj=:merc**

To make coastline maps we use `coast <https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/GMTjl_doc/documentation/modules/coast/>`_ which automatically
will access the GMT coastline, river and border data base derived from the GSHHG database [See *Wessel and Smith*, 1996].
In addition to the common switches we may need to use some of several coast-specific options:

============== ================================================================================================
Option         Purpose
============== ================================================================================================
**area**       Exclude small features or those of high hierarchical levels (see `GSHHG <https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gshhg-gmt#readme>`_.)
**resolution** Select data resolution (**f**\ ull, **h**\ igh, **i**\ ntermediate, **l**\ ow, or **c**\ rude)
**land**       Set color of dry areas (default does not paint)
**rivers**     Draw rivers (chose features from one or more hierarchical categories)
**map_scale**  Plot map scale (length scale can be km, miles, or nautical miles)
**borders**    Draw political borders (including US state borders)
**ocean**      Set color for wet areas (default does not paint)
**shore**      Draw coastlines and set pen thickness
============== ================================================================================================

One of **shore**, **land**, **ocean** must be selected. Our first coastline example is from Latin America:

   ::

    coast(region=(-90,-70,0,20), proj=:merc, land=:chocolate, show=true)

Your plot should look like :ref:`our example 3 below <gmt_tut_3_jl>`

.. _gmt_tut_3_jl:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_3.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 3.

Exercises:

#. Add the **verbose** option.
#. Try **region=**\ (270,290,0,20) instead. What happens to the annotations?
#. Edit your gmt.conf file, change :term:`FORMAT_GEO_MAP`
   to another setting (see the :doc:`/gmt.conf` documentation), and plot again.
#. Pick another region and change land color.
#. Pick a region that includes the north or south poles.
#. Try **shore**\ ="0.25\ **p**" instead of (or in addition to) **land**.

Albers projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Albers projection (**poj=:albers**) is an equal-area conical projection;
its conformal cousin is the Lambert conic projection (**proj=:lambert**).
Their usages are almost identical so we will only use the Albers here.
The general syntax is

    proj=(name=:albers, center=(lon_0,lat_0), parallels=(lat_1,lat_2))

where (*lon_0, lat_0*) is the map (projection) center and *lat_1, lat_2*
are the two standard parallels where the cone intersects the Earth's surface.
We try the following command:

   ::

    coast(region=(-130,-70,24,52), proj=(name=:albers, center=(-100,35), parallels=(33,45)),
          title="Conic Projection", borders=((type=1, pen=:thicker), (type=2, pen=:thinnest)),
          area=500, land=:gray, coast=:thinnest, show=true)

Your plot should look like :ref:`our example 4 below <gmt_tut_4_jl>`

.. _gmt_tut_4_jl:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_4.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 4.

Exercises:

#. Change the parameter :term:`MAP_GRID_CROSS_SIZE_PRIMARY` to make grid crosses instead of gridlines.

#. Change **region** to a rectangular box specification instead of minimum and maximum values.

Orthographic projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The azimuthal orthographic projection (**proj=:ortho**) is one of several projections with similar syntax and
behavior; the one we have chosen mimics viewing the Earth from space at an infinite distance; it is neither
conformal nor equal-area. The syntax for this projection is

    proj=(name=:ortho, center=(lon_0,lat_0))

where (*lon_0, lat_0*) is the center of the map (projection). As an example we will try

   ::

    coast(region=:global360, proj=(name=:ortho, center=(280,30)), frame=(annot=:a, grid=:a),
          area=5000, land=:white, ocean=:DarkTurquoise, show=true)

Your plot should look like :ref:`our example 5 below <gmt_tut_5_jl>`

.. _gmt_tut_5_jl:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_5.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 5

Exercises:

#. Use the rectangular option in **region** to make a rectangular map showing the US only.

Eckert IV and VI projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We conclude the survey of map projections with the Eckert IV and VI projections, two of several projections
used for global thematic maps; They are both equal-area projections whose syntax is

    proj=(name=:EckertIV, center=lon_0)
    proj=(name=:EckertVI, center=lon_0)

The *lon_0* is the central meridian (which takes precedence over the mid-value implied by the **region** setting).
A simple Eckert VI world map is thus generated by

   ::

    coast(region=:global360, proj=(name=:EckertVI, center=180), frame=(annot=:a, grid=:a), resolution=:crude,
          area=5000, land=:chocolate, shore=:thinnest, ocean=:DarkTurquoise, show=true)

Your plot should look like :ref:`our example 6 below <gmt_tut_6_jl>`

.. _gmt_tut_6_jl:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_6.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 6

Exercises:

#. Center the map on Greenwich.

#. Add a map scale with **map_scale**.
