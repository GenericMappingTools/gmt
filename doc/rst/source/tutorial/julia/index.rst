The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce users to the GMT Julia wrapper, outline the
GMT environment, and enable you to make several forms of graphics. We will not be able to
cover all aspects of GMT nor will we necessarily cover the selected topics in sufficient detail.
Nevertheless, it is hoped that the exposure will prompt the users to improve their GMT skills
after completion of this short tutorial.

Also, not all GMT module manuals have been converted to the verbose Julia syntax so some links
still redirect to the hard-core GMT man pages, whilst others direct users to Julia versions of
the translated GMT manuals. A *lost case* is the GMT Technical Reference that is so big/complete that it
will take long time to see a Julia version of it.

See the :doc:`install guide </install>`
for instructions and to make sure you have all required dependencies installed.
Alternatively, you can build GMT from source by following the
`building guide <https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/blob/master/BUILDING.md>`_.

In addition, we recommend access to any flavor of the UNIX operating system
(UNIX, Linux, macOS, Cygwin, MinGW, etc.).
We do not recommend using the DOS command window under Windows.
