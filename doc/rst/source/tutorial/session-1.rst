Session One
===========

Tutorial setup
--------------

#. We assume that GMT has been properly and fully
   installed and that the GMT executables are in your executable path.
   You should be able to type ``gmt`` in your terminal and it will display
   the GMT splash screen with version number
   and the top-level options.  If not then you need to work on your user
   environment, adding the path to the gmt executable to your search path.

#. All GMT man pages, documentation, and gallery example scripts
   are available from the GMT documentation web page.  It is
   assumed these pages have been installed locally at your site;
   if not they are always available from https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org.

#. We recommend you create a sub-directory called *tutorial*,
   cd into that directory, and run the commands there to keep things tidy.

#. As we discuss GMT principles it may be a good idea to
   consult :doc:`the GMT Cookbook </cookbook>` for more
   detailed explanations.

#. The tutorial data sets are distributed via the GMT cache server.
   You will therefore find that all the data files have a "@" prepended to
   their names.  This will ensure the file is copied from the server
   before being used, hence you do not need to download any of the
   data manually.  The only downside is that you will need an Internet
   connection to run the examples by cut and paste.

#. For all but the simplest GMT jobs it is recommended that
   you place all the GMT (and UNIX) commands in a shell script
   file and make it executable.  To ensure that UNIX recognizes
   your script as a shell script it is a good habit always to start
   the script with the line ``#!/usr/bin/env bash`` or ``#!/usr/bin/env csh``,
   depending on the shell you prefer to use.
   All the examples in this tutorial assumes you are running the Bourne Again shell, bash,
   and you will need to modify some of the constructs, such as i/o redirection, to run
   these examples under csh.
   We strongly recommend bash over csh due the ability to define *functions*.

#. Making a script executable is accomplished using the chmod
   command, e.g., the script figure\_1.sh is made executable
   with "chmod +x figure\_1.sh".

#. Please cd into the directory *tutorial*.  We are
   now ready to start.

The GMT environment: What happens when you run GMT ?
----------------------------------------------------

To get a good grasp on GMT one must understand what is going on "under
the hood".  The :ref:`GMT Run-Time Environment <gmt_environ>` illustrates the relationships
you need to be aware of at run-time.

.. _gmt_environ:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_Environment.png
   :width: 600 px
   :align: center

   The GMT run-time environment.  The will initiate with a set of system defaults that
   you can override with having your own gmt.conf file in the current directory, specifying
   GMT parameters via the *--PAR=value* technique, and supply module options.  Some GMT modules
   will read hidden data (like coastlines) but most will explicitly need to be given user data.

Input data
~~~~~~~~~~

A GMT module may or may not take input files.  Three different
types of input are recognized (more details can be found in :doc:`/cookbook/file_formats`):

#. Data tables.
   These are rectangular tables with a fixed number of columns and
   unlimited number of rows.  We distinguish between two groups:

    * ASCII (Preferred unless files are huge)

    * Binary (to speed up input/output)

   Such tables may have segment headers and can therefore hold any number of
   subsets such as individual line segments or polygons.

#. Gridded dated sets.
   These are data matrices (evenly spaced in two coordinates) that come
   in two flavors:

    * Grid-line registration

    * Pixel registration

   You may choose among several file formats (even define your own format),
   but the GMT default is the architecture-independent netCDF format.

#. Color palette table (For imaging, color plots, and contour maps).
   We will discuss these later.


Job Control
~~~~~~~~~~~

GMT modules may get operational parameters from several places:

#. Supplied command line options/switches or module defaults.

#. Short-hand notation to select previously used option arguments
   (stored in gmt.history).

#. Implicitly using GMT defaults for a variety of parameters
   (stored in :doc:`/gmt.conf`).

#. May use hidden support data like coastlines or PostScript patterns.

Output data
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 6 general categories of output produced by GMT:

#. PostScript plot commands.

#. Data Table(s).

#. Gridded data set(s).

#. Statistics & Summaries.

#. Warnings and Errors, written to *stderr*.

#. Exit status (0 means success, otherwise failure).

Note: GMT automatically creates and updates a history of past
GMT command options for the common switches.  This history
file is called gmt.history and one will be created in
every directory from which GMT modules are executed.  Many
initial problems with GMT usage result from not fully appreciating
the relationships shown in Figure :ref:`GMT Environment <gmt_environ>` .

The UNIX Environment: Entry Level Knowledge
-------------------------------------------

Redirection
~~~~~~~~~~~

Most GMT modules read their input from the terminal (called
*stdin*) or from files, and write their output to the
terminal (called *stdout*).  To use files instead one can
use redirection::

    gmt module input-file > output-file		# Read a file and redirect output
    gmt module < input-file > output-file	# Redirect input and output
    gmt module input-file >> output-file	# Append output to existing file

In this example, and in all those to follow, it is assumed that you do not have the shell
variable **noclobber** set. If you do, it prevents accidental overwriting of existing files.
That may be a noble cause, but it is extremely annoying. So please, **unset noclobber**.

Piping (\|)
~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes we want to use the output from one module as input
to another module.  This is achieved with *pipes*::

    Someprogram | gmt module1 | gmt module1 > OutputFile

Standard error (*stderr*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most programs and GMT modules will on occasion write error messages.
These are typically written to a separate data stream called
*stderr* and can be redirected separately from the standard
output (which goes to *stdout*).  To send the error messages to the same location
as standard output we use::

    program > errors.log 2>&1

When we want to save both program output and error messages to
separate files we use the following syntax::

    gmt module > output.txt 2> errors.log

File name expansion or "wild cards"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UNIX provides several ways to select groups of files based
on name patterns:

  +---------+---------------------------------------+
  |  Code   | Meaning                               |
  +=========+=======================================+
  | \*      | Matches anything                      |
  +---------+---------------------------------------+
  | \?      | Matches any single character          |
  +---------+---------------------------------------+
  | *list*  | Matches characters in the list        |
  +---------+---------------------------------------+
  | *range* | Matches characters in the given range |
  +---------+---------------------------------------+

You can save much time by getting into the habit of selecting
"good" filenames that make it easy to select subsets of all
files using the UNIX wild card notation.

Examples:

#. gmt module data\_*.txt operates on all files starting with
   "data\_" and ending in ".txt".

#. gmt module line\_?.txt works on all files starting with
   "line\_" followed by any single character and ending in ".txt".

#. gmt module section\_1[0-9]0.part\_[12] only processes data
   from sections 100 through 190, only using every 10th profile, and
   gets both part 1 and 2.

Laboratory Exercises
--------------------

We will begin our adventure by making some simple plot axes and
coastline basemaps.  We will do this in order to introduce the
all-important common options **-B**, **-J**, and **-R** and to familiarize
ourselves with a few selected GMT projections.  The GMT modules
we will utilize are :doc:`/basemap` and :doc:`/coast`.  Please
consult their manual pages for reference.

Linear projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We start by making the basemap frame for a linear *x-y* plot.
We want it to go from 10 to 70 in *x* and
from -3 to 8 in *y*, with automatic annotation intervals.  Finally,
we let the canvas be painted light red and have dimensions of
4 by 3 inches.  Here's how we do it:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_tut_1.txt

This script will open the result GMT_tut_1.pdf in a PDF viewer and it should look like :ref:`our example 1 below <gmt_tut_1>`.
Examine the :doc:`/basemap` documentation so you understand what each option means.

.. _gmt_tut_1:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_1.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 1.

Exercises:

#. Try change the **-JX** values.

#. Try change the **-B** values.

#. Change title and canvas color.


Logarithmic projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We next will show how to do a basemap for a logâ€“log plot.  We have
no data set yet but we will
imagine that the raw *x* data range from 3 to 9613 and that *y*
ranges from 10^20 to 10^24.  One possibility is

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_tut_2.txt

Make sure your plot looks like :ref:`our example 2 below <gmt_tut_2>`

.. _gmt_tut_2:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_2.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 2.

Exercises:

#. Do not append **l** to the axes lengths.

#. Leave the **p** modifier out of the **-B** string.

#. Add **g**\ 3 to **-Bx** and **-By**.

Mercator projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Despite the problems of extreme horizontal exaggeration at high
latitudes, the conformal Mercator projection (**-JM**) remains
the stalwart of location maps used by scientists.  It is one
of several cylindrical projections offered by GMT; here we
will only have time to focus on one such projection.  The
complete syntax is simply

**-JM**\ *width*

To make coastline maps we use :doc:`/coast` which automatically will
access the GMT coastline, river and border data base derived from the GSHHG
database [See *Wessel and Smith*, 1996].  In addition
to the common switches we may need to use some of several coast-specific options:

  +--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Option | Purpose                                                                                        |
  +========+================================================================================================+
  | **-A** | Exclude small features or those of high hierarchical levels (see :doc:`/datasets/gshhg`        |
  +--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | **-D** | Select data resolution (**f**\ ull, **h**\ igh, **i**\ ntermediate, **l**\ ow, or **c**\ rude) |
  +--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | **-G** | Set color of dry areas (default does not paint)                                                |
  +--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | **-I** | Draw rivers (chose features from one or more hierarchical categories)                          |
  +--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | **-L** | Plot map scale (length scale can be km, miles, or nautical miles)                              |
  +--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | **-N** | Draw political borders (including US state borders)                                            |
  +--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | **-S** | Set color for wet areas (default does not paint)                                               |
  +--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | **-W** | Draw coastlines and set pen thickness                                                          |
  +--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

One of **-W**, **-G**, **-S** must be selected.  Our first coastline
example is from Latin America:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_tut_3.txt

Your plot should look like :ref:`our example 3 below <gmt_tut_3>`

.. _gmt_tut_3:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_3.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 3.

Exercises:

#. Add the **-V** option.
#. Try **-R**\ 270/290/0/20 instead.  What happens to the annotations?
#. Edit your gmt.conf file, change :term:`FORMAT_GEO_MAP`
   to another setting (see the :doc:`/gmt.conf` documentation), and plot again.
#. Pick another region and change land color.
#. Pick a region that includes the north or south poles.
#. Try **-W**\ 0.25\ **p** instead of (or in addition to) **-G**.

Albers projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Albers projection (**-JB**) is an equal-area conical projection;
its conformal cousin is the Lambert conic projection (**-JL**).
Their usages are almost identical so we will only use the Albers here.
The general syntax is

    **-JB**\ *lon_0/lat_0/lat_1/lat_2/width*

where (*lon_0, lat_0*) is the map (projection) center and *lat_1, lat_2*
are the two standard parallels where the cone intersects the Earth's surface.
We try the following command:

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_tut_4.txt

Your plot should look like :ref:`our example 4 below <gmt_tut_4>`

.. _gmt_tut_4:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_4.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 4.

Exercises:

#. Change the parameter :term:`MAP_GRID_CROSS_SIZE_PRIMARY` to make grid crosses instead of gridlines.

#. Change **-R** to a rectangular box specification instead of
   minimum and maximum values.

Orthographic projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The azimuthal orthographic projection (**-JG**) is one of several
projections with similar syntax and behavior; the one we have
chosen mimics viewing the Earth from space at an infinite distance;
it is neither conformal nor equal-area.
The syntax for this projection is

**-JG**\ *lon_0/lat_0/width*

where (*lon_0, lat_0*) is the center of the map (projection).
As an example we will try

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_tut_5.txt

Your plot should look like :ref:`our example 5 below <gmt_tut_5>`

.. _gmt_tut_5:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_5.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 5

Exercises:

#. Use the rectangular option in **-R** to make a rectangular map
   showing the US only.

Eckert IV and VI projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We conclude the survey of map projections with the Eckert IV and VI projections
(**-JK**), two of several projections used for global thematic maps; They
are both equal-area projections whose syntax is

**-JK**\ [**f**\|\ **s**]\ *lon_0/width*

where **b** gives Eckert IV (4) and **s** (Default) gives Eckert VI (6).
The *lon_0* is the central meridian (which takes precedence over
the mid-value implied by the **-R** setting).  A simple Eckert VI world map
is thus generated by

.. literalinclude:: /_verbatim/GMT_tut_6.txt

Your plot should look like :ref:`our example 6 below <gmt_tut_6>`

.. _gmt_tut_6:

.. figure:: /_images/GMT_tut_6.*
   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   Result of GMT Tutorial example 6

Exercises:

#. Center the map on Greenwich.

#. Add a map scale with **-L**.
