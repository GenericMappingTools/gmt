**-C**\ [*cpt* \|\ *master*\ [**+h**\ [*hinge*][**+i**\ *zinc*][**u**\ \|\ **U**\ *unit*] \|\ *color1,color2*\ [,\ *color3*\ ,...]]
    Name of the CPT. If a GMT Master soft-hinge CPT (:ref:`Of Colors and Color Legends`) then
    you can enable a hinge at *hinge* [0] via **+h**.  For other CPTs, you may convert its *z*-values
    from meter to another unit (append **+U**\ *unit*) or from another unit to meter (append **+u**\ *unit*).
    Alternatively, give *color1,color2*\ [*,color3*\ ,...]
    to build a linear continuous CPT from those colors automatically,
    where *z* starts at 0 and is incremented by one for each color.
    In this case *color*\ **n** can be a r/g/b triplet, a color name,
    or an HTML hexadecimal color (e.g. #aabbcc).
