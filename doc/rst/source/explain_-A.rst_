|SYN_OPT-Area|
    Features with an area smaller than *min\_area* in km^2 or of
    hierarchical level that is lower than *min\_level* or higher than
    *max\_level* will not be plotted [Default is 0/0/4 (all features)].
    Level 2 (lakes) contains regular lakes and wide river bodies which
    we normally include as lakes; append **+r** to just get river-lakes
    or **+l** to just get regular lakes.  Append **+p**\ *percent* to
    exclude polygons whose percentage area of the corresponding full-resolution
    feature is less than *percent*.  Use **+a** to control special
    aspects of the Antarctica coastline: By default (or add **i**) we
    select the ice shelf boundary as the coastline for Antarctica; alternatively,
    add **g** to select the ice grounding line instead.  For expert
    users who wish to utilize their own Antarctica (with islands) coastline
    you can add **s** to skip all GSHHG features below 60S. In contrast, you
    can add **S** to instead skip all features *north* of 60S.  See
    GSHHG INFORMATION below for more details. |Add_-A|
