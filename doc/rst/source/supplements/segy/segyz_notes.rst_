Variable area involves filling four-sided figures of distressing
generality. I *know* that some of the more complex degenerate cases are
not dealt with correctly or at all; the incidence of such cases
increases as viewing angles become more oblique, and particularly as the
viewing elevation increases. Wiggle-trace plotting is not affected.
