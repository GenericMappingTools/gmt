Description
-----------

**flexure** computes the flexural response to 2-D loads using a range
of user-selectable options, such as boundary conditions, pre-existing
deformations, variable rigidity and restoring force, and more.  The solutions
are obtained using finite difference approximations to the differential
equations.

Required Arguments
------------------

.. _-D:

**-D**\ *rm*/*rl*\ [/*ri*]\ /*rw*
    Sets density for mantle, load, infill (optionally, otherwise it is
    assumed to equal the load density), and water.  If *ri* is not given
    then it defaults to *rl*.

.. _-E:

**-E**\ *Te*\ [**u**]\|\ *D*\|\ *file*
    Sets the elastic plate thickness (in meter); append **k** for km.
    If the elastic thickness exceeds 1e10 it will be interpreted as
    a flexural rigidity **D** instead (by default **D** is computed from *Te*, Young's
    modulus, and Poisson's ratio; see **-C** to change these values).
    Alternatively, supply a *file* with variable plate thicknesses or rigidities.
    The file must be co-registered with any file given via **-Q**.

Optional Arguments
------------------

.. _-A:

**-A**\ [**l**\|\ **r**]\ *bc*\ [/*args*]
    Sets the boundary conditions at the **l**\ eft and **r**\ ight boundary.
    The *bc* can be one of four codes: 0 selects the infinity condition, were
    both the deflection and its slope are set to zero.  1 selects the periodic
    condition where both the first and third derivatives of the deflection are set to zero.
    2 selects the clamped condition where *args* (if given) sets the deflection
    value [0] (and its first derivative is set to zero), while 3 selects the free condition
    where *args* is given as *moment*/*force* which specify the end bending
    moment and vertical shear force [0/0].  Use SI units for any optional arguments.

.. _-C:

**-Cp**\ *Poisson*
    Change the current value of Poisson's ratio [0.25].

**-Cy**\ *Young*
    Change the current value of Young's modulus [7.0e10 N/m^2].

.. _-F:

**-F**\ *force*
    Set a constant horizontal in-plane force, in Pa m [0]

.. _-L:

**-L**
    Use a variable restoring force that depends on sign of the flexure [constant].

.. _-Q:

**-Qn**\|\ **q**\|\ **t**\ [*args*]
    Sets the vertical load specification. Choose among these three options:
    **-Qn** means there is no input load file and that any deformation is
    simply driven by the boundary conditions set via **-A**.  If no rigidity or
    elastic thickness file is given via **-E** then you must also append arguments
    to create the locations used for the calculations; for details on array creation,
    see `Generate 1D Array`_.
    **-Qq**\ [*loadfile*] is a file (or stdin if not given) with (x,load in Pa)
    for all equidistant data locations.  Finally, **-Qt**\ [*topofile*] is a file
    (or stdin if not given) with (x,load in m or km, positive up); see **-M** for
    topography unit used [m].

.. _-S:

**-S**
    Compute the curvature along with the deflections and report them via the
    third output column [none].

.. _-T:

**-T**\ *wfile*
    Supply a file with pre-existing deformations [undeformed surface].

.. _-W:

**-W**\ *wd*
    Specify water depth in m; append k for km.  Must be positive [0].
    Any subaerial topography will be scaled via the densities set in **-D**
    to compensate for the larger density contrast with air.

.. _-Z:

**-Z**\ *zm*
    Specify reference depth to flexed surface in m; append k for km.  Must be positive [0].
    We add this value to the flexed surface before output.

.. _-V:

.. |Add_-V| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: ../../explain_-V.rst_

.. |Add_-bi| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: ../../explain_-bi.rst_

.. include:: ../../explain_-d.rst_

.. |Add_-e| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code

.. |Add_-h| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: ../../explain_-h.rst_

.. include:: ../../explain_array.rst_

Note on Units
-------------

The **-M** option controls the units used in all input and output files.
However, this option does *not* control values given on the command line
to the **-E**, **-W**, and **-Z** options.  These are assumed to be in
meters unless an optional **k** for km is appended.

Plate Flexure Notes
-------------------

We solve for plate flexure using a finite difference approach. This method can
accommodate situations such as variable rigidity, restoring force that depends
on the deflection being positive or negative, pre-existing deformation, and
different boundary conditions.

Examples
--------

To compute elastic plate flexure from the topography load in *topo.txt*,
for a 10 km thick plate with typical densities, try

   ::

    gmt flexure -Qttopo.txt -E10k -D2700/3300/1035 > flex.txt
