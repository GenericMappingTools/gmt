Description
-----------

**gshhg** reads the binary coastline (GSHHG) or political boundary or
river (WDBII) files and writes an ASCII (or binary; see **-b**) listing
to standard output. It automatically
handles byte-swabbing between different architectures. Optionally, only
segment header info can be displayed. The header info has the format *ID
npoints hierarchical-level source area f\_area west east south north
container ancestor*, where hierarchical levels for coastline polygons go
from 1 (shoreline) to 4 (lake inside island inside lake inside land).
Source is either W (World Vector Shoreline) or C (CIA World Data Bank
II); lower case is used if a lake is a river-lake. The *west east south
north* is the enclosing rectangle, *area* is the polygon area in km^2
while *f\_area* is the actual area of the ancestor polygon, *container*
is the ID of the polygon that contains this polygon (-1 if none), and
*ancestor* is the ID of the polygon in the full resolution set that was
reduced to yield this polygon (-1 if full resolution since there is no
ancestor). For line data the header is simply *ID npoints
hierarchical-level source west east south north*. For more information
about the file formats, see TECHNICAL INFORMATION below.

Required Arguments
------------------

*binaryfile.b*
    GSHHG or WDBII binary data file as distributed with the GSHHG data
    supplement. Any of the 5 standard resolutions (full, high,
    intermediate, low, crude) can be used.

Optional Arguments
------------------

.. _-A:

**-A**\ *min*
    Only output information for the polygon if its area equals or
    exceeds *min* [Default outputs all polygons].

.. _-G:

**-G**
    Write output that can be imported into GNU Octave or Matlab by
    ending segments with a NaN-record.

.. _-I:

**-I**\ *id*
    Only output information for the polygon that matches *id*. Use
    **-Ic** to get all the continents only [Default outputs all
    polygons].  See below for the *id* of the largest polygons.

.. _-L:

**-L**
    Only output a listing of polygon or line segment headers [Default
    outputs headers and data records].

.. _-N:

**-N**
    Only output features whose level matches the given *level* [Default
    will output all levels].

.. _-Q:

**-Qe**\|\ **i**
    Control what to do with river-lakes (river sections large enough to
    be stored as closed polygons). Use **-Qe** to exclude them and
    **-Qi** to exclude everything else instead [Default outputs all
    polygons].

Examples
--------

To convert the entire intermediate GSHHG binary data to ASCII files for
Octave/Matlab, run

   ::

    gmt gshhg gshhs_i.b --IO_SEGMENT_MARKER=N > gshhs_i.txt

To only get a listing of the headers for the river data set at full
resolution, try

   ::

    gmt gshhg wdb_rivers_f.b -L > riverlisting.txt

To only extract lakes, excluding river-lakes, from the high resolution
file, try

   ::

    gmt gshhg gshhs_h.b -Ee -N2 > all_lakes.txt

Specific Polygons
-----------------

None of the polygons have any name information associated with them (i.e.,
the metadata does not contain this information).  However, here are the
largest polygons:

Data Files
----------

The data files read by gshhg are the native binary polygon files,
available from `NCEI Shoreline Coastline Resources <https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/>`_ or
the `SOEST GSHHG Site <https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg>`_. Note that these
are different from the netCDF-formatted files used by GMT in the
modules :doc:`gmtselect </gmtselect>`, :doc:`grdlandmask </grdlandmask>`,
or :doc:`coast </coast>`.


Technical Information
---------------------

Users who wish to access the GSHHG or WDBII data directly from their
custom programs should consult the gshhg.c and gshhg.h source code and
familiarize themselves with the data format and how various information
flags are packed into a single 4-byte integer. While we do not maintain
any Octave/Matlab code to read these files we are aware that both
MathWorks and IDL have made such tools available to their users.
However, they tend not to update their code and our file structure has
evolved considerably over time, breaking their code. Here, some general
technical comments on the binary data files are given.
**GSHHG**: These files contain completely closed polygons of continents
and islands (level 1), lakes (level 2), islands-in-lakes (level 3) and
ponds-in-islands-in-lakes (level 4); a particular level can be extracted
using the **-N** option. Continents are identified as the first 6
polygons and can be extracted via the **-Ic** option. The IDs for the
continents are Eurasia (0), Africa (1), North America
(2), South America (3), Antarctica (4), and Australia
(5). Files are sorted on area from large to small.
There are two sub-groups for level 2: Regular lakes and the so-called
"river-lakes", the latter being sections of a river that are so wide to
warrant a polygon representation. These river-lakes are flagged in the
header (also see **-Q**). All five resolutions are free of
self-intersections. Areas of all features have been computed using a
Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection centered on the polygon
centroids, using WGS-84 as the ellipsoid. GMT use the GSHHG as a
starting point but then partition the polygons into pieces using a
resolution-dependent binning system; parts of the world are then rebuilt
into closed polygons on the fly as needed. For more information on GSHHG
processing, see Wessel and Smith (1996).
**WDBII**. These files contain sets of line segments not necessarily in
any particular order. Thus, it is not possible to extract information
pertaining to just one river or one country. Furthermore, the 4 lower
resolutions derive directly from the full resolution by application of
the Douglas-Peucker algorithm (see gshhg\_dp), hence self-intersections
are increasingly likely as the resolution is degraded. Note that the
river-lakes included in GSHHG are also duplicated in the WDBII river
files so that each data set can be a stand-alone representation. Users
who wish to access both data sets can recognize the river-lakes features
by examining the header structure (see the source code for details);
they are also the only closed polygons in the WDBII river file. There
are many levels (classes) in the river file: River-lakes (0), Permanent
major rivers (1), Additional major rivers
(2), Additional rivers (3), Minor rivers (4), Intermittent rivers – major
(6), Intermittent rivers – additional (7), Intermittent rivers – minor
(8), Major canals (10), Canals of lesser importance
(11), and Canals – irrigation type (12). For the border file there are
three levels: National boundaries (1), Internal
domestic boundaries (2), and international
maritime boundaries (3). Individual levels or
classes may be extracted via **-N**.
