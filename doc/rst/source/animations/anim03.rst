.. _anim03:

(3) Orbiting a static map
-------------------------

Our third animation keeps a fixed gridded data set but moves the camera
angle around the full 360. We use
:doc:`grdview </grdview>` to generate a shaded-relief
image sequence. No additional
information is plotted on the image. As before we produce a MP4 movie.
