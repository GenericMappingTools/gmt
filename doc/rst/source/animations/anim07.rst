(7) Spinning Earth showing crustal ages
----------------------------------------

Animation of a spinning Earth showing the crustal ages from EarthByte for the oceans
and topographic relief on land, with shading given by the global relief and modified
by position relative to an artificial sun in the east.  A progress slice is added as well.
We add a 1 second fade in and a 1 second fade out for the animation

- DEM:   @earth_relief_02m.grd
- Ages:  @earth_age_02m.grd

The resulting movie was presented at the Fall 2019 AGU meeting in an eLighting talk:
P. Wessel, 2019, GMT science animations for the masses, Abstract IN21B-11.
The finished movie is available in our YouTube channel as well (without fading):

The movie took ~2.5 hours to render on a 24-core MacPro 2013.
