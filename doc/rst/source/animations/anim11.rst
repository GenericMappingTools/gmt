(11) Wrapping the Marbles on a Sphere
=====================================

Using :doc:`/grdmix`, we are blending the NASA day and night views from the Blue and Black Marble mosaic
images using a day-night mask set for the summer solstice midnight in Hawaii
on June 20, 2020.  In addition, we adjust the colors using the intensities derived
from the slopes of the earth relief grid.  We spin the view point around at 24 frames per second
where each frame advances the viewpoint 0.25 degrees of longitude.
