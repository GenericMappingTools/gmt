(14) Animating earthquake focal mechanisms
==========================================

Here we make a movie of the focal mechanisms of large earthquakes from September 1981
to January 2018 in the flat subduction area in western Argentina and central Chile.
The events are shown on a location map with a cross-sectional profile below. 
We use new capability in :doc:`/events` to animate seismological symbols that are ultimately
generated by :doc:`/supplements/seis/meca` and :doc:`/supplements/seis/coupe`.  The data are
obtained from the Global CMT web page at https://www.globalcmt.org/. Animation designed
by Federico D. Esteban, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
