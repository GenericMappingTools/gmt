.. _-c_full:

**-c**\ [*row*\ ,\ *col*]
    Used to advance to the selected subplot panel.  Only allowed when in
    subplot mode.  Available to all plot modules.  If no arguments are
    given then we advance to the next panel in the selected order. If
    no **-c** is given and we just entered subplot mode then the first
    panel (top, left) is selected.
