**-i**\ *cols*\ [**+l**\ ][\ **+s**\ *scale*][\ **+o**\ *offset*][,\ *...*]
    Select specific data columns for primary input, in arbitrary order. Columns
    not listed will be skipped. Give individual columns (or column ranges
    in the format *start*\ [:*inc* \]:*stop*, where *inc* defaults to 1 if
    not specified) separated by commas [Default reads all columns in order,
    starting with the first column (0)]. Columns may be repeated.  To each
    column, optionally add any of  the following: **+l** takes **log10** of
    the input values first; **+s**\ *scale*, subsequently multiplies by a
    given  scale factor [1]; **+o**\ *offset*, finally adds a given offset [0].
    Normally, any trailing text is read but when **i** is used you must add
    the column **t** to retain the text. Finally, **-in** will simply read
    the numerical input and skip any trailing text.
