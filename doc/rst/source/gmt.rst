    The Generic Mapping Tools data processing and display software package

Introduction
------------

GMT is a collection of public-domain Unix tools that allows you to
manipulate x,y and x,y,z data sets (filtering, trend fitting, gridding,
projecting, etc.) and produce PostScript illustrations ranging from
simple x-y plots, via contour maps, to artificially illuminated surfaces
and 3-D perspective views in black/white or full color. Linear, log10,
and power scaling is supported in addition to over 30 common map
projections. The processing and display routines within GMT are
completely general and will handle any (x,y) or (x,y,z) data as input.

Synopsis
--------

**gmt** is the main program that can start any of the modules:

**gmt** *module* *module-options*

Starts a given GMT *module* with the *module-options*
that pertain to that particular module.  A few special commands
are also available:

**gmt clear** *items*

Deletes the user's history.  Choose between **history** (deletes the
gmt.history file in the current directory), **conf** (deletes the gmt.conf
file in the current directory), **cache** (deletes the user's cache directory
and all of its content), or **all** (does all of the above).

**gmt begin** [*session-prefix*] [*format*]

Initializes a new GMT session under *modern* mode [Default is *classic* mode].
This is experimental; see http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/wiki/Modernization
for the current description.  All work is performed in a temporary work directory.
The optional *session-prefix* assigns a name to the session, and this may be used
as figure name for single-figure sessions [gmtsession].  Likewise, the optional
*format* can be used to override the default graphics format [PDF].

**gmt figure** [*prefix*] [*format(s)*] [*options*]

Specifies the desired name, output format(s) and any custom arguments that should
be passed to :doc:`psconvert` when producing this figure.  All subsequent plotting
will be directed to this current figure until another **gmt figure** command is issued
or the session ends.  The *prefix* is used to build final figure names when extensions
are automatically appended. The *format* setting is a comma-separated list of desired
extensions (e.g., pdf,png). 

**gmt end**

Terminates a GMT modern mode session and automatically converts the registered
illustration(s) to the specified formats, then eliminates the temporary work
directory.  The figures are placed in the current directory.

If no module is given then
several other options are available:

**-**\ **-help**
    List and description of GMT modules.

**-**\ **-show-cores**
    Show number of available cores.

**-**\ **-show-bindir** 
    Show directory of executables and exit.

**-**\ **-show-datadir**
    Show data directory/ies and exit.

**-**\ **-show-modules**
    List module names on stdout and exit.

**-**\ **-show-plugindir**
    Show plugin directory and exit.

**-**\ **-show-sharedir**
    Show share directory and exit.

**-**\ **-version**
    Print version and exit.

**=**
    Check if that module exist and if so the
    program will exit with status of 0; otherwise the status of exit will
    be non-zero.

Command-line completion
-----------------------

GMT provides basic command-line completion (tab completion) for bash.
The completion rules are either installed in ``/etc/bash_completion.d/gmt``
or ``<prefix>/share/tools/gmt_completion.bash``.  Depending on the
distribution, you may still need to source the gmt completion file from
``~/.bash_completion`` or ``~/.bashrc``.  For more information see Section
:ref:`command-line-completion` in the CookBook.

GMT Overview
------------

The following is a summary of all the programs supplied with GMT and
a very short description of their purpose. Detailed information about
each program can be found in the separate manual pages.

.. include:: explain_gmt_modules.rst_

Custom Modules
--------------

The **gmt** program can also load custom modules from shared libraries
built as specified in the GMT API documentation.  This way your modules
can benefit form the GMT infrastructure and extend GMT in specific ways.
