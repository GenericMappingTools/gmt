Grid File Formats
-----------------

By default GMT writes out grids as single precision floats in a COARDS-complaint
netCDF file format. However, GMT is able to produce and read grid files in many
other commonly used grid file formats and also facilitates so called "packing"
of grids, writing out floating point data as 1- or 2-byte integers. To specify
the precision, scale and offset, the user should add the suffix
[**=**\ *ID*][**+d**\ *divisor*][**+n**\ *invalid*][**+o**\ *offset*][**+s**\ *scale*], where
*ID* is a two-letter identifier of the grid type and precision, and the
*scale* (or *divisor*), *offset* and *invalid* are the arguments of optional modifiers to be applied
to all grid values,  Here, *invalid* is the value used to indicate missing
data. In case the *ID* is not provided, as in **+s**\ *scale*, then a
*ID*\ **=**\ *nf* is assumed. When reading grids, the format is generally
automatically recognized from almost all of those formats that GMT and GDAL
combined offer. If not, the same suffix can be added to input grid file names.
If reading an image as a grid you can select the band via **+b**.
See :doc:`grdconvert </grdconvert>` and Section :ref:`grid-file-format`
of the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook for more information regarding GDAL settings.

When reading a netCDF file that contains multiple grids, GMT will
read, by default, the first 2-dimensional grid that it can find in that
file. To coax GMT into reading another multi-dimensional variable in
the grid file, append **?**\ *varname* to the file name, where *varname*
is the name of the variable. Note that you may need to escape the
special meaning of **?** in your shell program by putting a backslash in
front of it, or by placing the filename and suffix between quotes or
double quotes. The **?**\ *varname* suffix can also be used for output
grids to specify a variable name different from the default: "z". See
:doc:`grdconvert </grdconvert>` and Sections :ref:`modifiers-for-CF` and
:ref:`grid-file-format` of the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook for more
information, particularly on how to read slices of 3-, 4-, or 5-dimensional grids.

When writing a netCDF file, the grid is stored by default with the
variable name "z". To specify another variable name *varname*, append
**?**\ *varname* to the file name. Note that you may need to escape the
special meaning of **?** in your shell program by putting a backslash in
front of it, or by placing the filename and suffix between quotes or
double quotes.

[**+o**\ *offset*][**+s**\ *scale*]

    |Add_ingrid| Optionally, append =\ *ID* for reading a specific file
    format [Default is =\ *nf*] or ?\ *varname* for a specific netCDF variable
    [Default is the first 2-D grid found by GMT]
    (:ref:`See full description <grd_inout_full>`). The following modifiers are
    supported:

       - **+b** - Select a *band* (for images only) [Default is 0].
       - **+d** - Divide data values by the given *divisor* [Default is 1].
       - **+n** - Replace data values matching *invalid* with NaN.
       - **+o** - Offset data values by the given *offset* [Default is 0].
       - **+s** - Scale data values by the given *scale* [Default is 1].

    Note: Any offset is added after any scaling.

[**+o**\ *offset*\|\ **a**][**+s**\ *scale*\|\ **a**]\
[:*driver*\ [*dataType*][**+c**\ *options*]]

    |Add_outgrid| Optionally, append =\ *ID* for writing a specific file format
    (:ref:`See full description <grd_inout_full>`). The following modifiers are
    supported:

        - **+d** - Divide data values by given *divisor* [Default is 1].
        - **+n** - Replace data values matching *invalid* with a NaN.
        - **+o** - Offset data values by the given *offset*, or append **a** for
          automatic range offset to preserve precision for integer grids
          [Default is 0].
        - **+s** - Scale data values by the given *scale*, or append **a** for
          automatic scaling to preserve precision for integer grids [Default
          is 1].

    **Note**: Any offset is added before any scaling. **+sa** also sets **+oa**
    (unless overridden). To write specific formats via GDAL, use =\ *gd*
    and supply *driver* (and optionally *dataType*) and/or one or more
    concatenated GDAL **-co** options using **+c**. See
    the :ref:`"Writing grids and images" cookbook section <Write-grids-images>`
    for more details.
