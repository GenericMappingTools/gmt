    Draw a map directional rose on the map at the location defined by the reference (*refpoint*) and anchor point
    (set by **+o**\ *dx*\ [/*dy*] and/or **+j**\ *justify*). Give the reference point on the map for the rose using one
    of four coordinate systems:

    .. include:: explain_refpoint.rst_

    The following modifiers can be appended to |-T|\ **d** (**+w** is required), with additional explanation and
    examples provided in the :ref:`Placing-dir-map-roses` cookbook section. Optionally, use |-F| to place a panel
    behind the directional rose.

    - **+w**\ *width* to set the width of the rose in plot coordinates (append **i**\ nch, **c**\ m, or **p**\ oints).
    - **+f**\ [*level*] to get a "fancy" rose, and optionally specify the *level* of fanciness. Level **1** draws
      the two principal E-W, N-S orientations, **2** adds the two intermediate NW-SE and NE-SW orientations, while **3**
      adds the eight minor orientations WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW, and ENE-WSW [default is **1**].
    - **+j**\ *justify* to set the justification :ref:`anchor point <Anchor_Point_j>`, where *justify* is a 2-character
      :ref:`justification code <Reference_Points>` that is a combination of a horizontal (**L**, **C**, or **R**) and a
      vertical (**T**, **M**, or **B**) code. **Note**: If **j** is used to set the reference point
      then *justify* defaults to the same as *refpoint*; if **J** is used then *justify* defaults to the mirror opposite
      of *refpoint*; if **g**, **n**, or **x** is used to set the reference point then *justify* defaults to **MC**.
    - **+l**\ [*w,e,s,n*] to label the cardinal points W,E,S,N. Optionally, append your own four comma-separated strings
      to override the default. Skip a specific label by leaving it blank.
    - **+o**\ *dx*\ [/*dy*] to offset the :ref:`anchor point <Anchor_Point_o>` by *dx* and optionally *dy* (if different
      than *dx*).

    Draw a map magnetic rose on the map at the location defined by the reference (*refpoint*) and anchor point
    (set by **+o**\ *dx*\ [/*dy*] and/or **+j**\ *justify*). Give the reference point on the map for the rose using one
    of four coordinate systems:

    .. include:: explain_refpoint.rst_

    The following modifiers can be appended to |-T|\ **m** (**+w** is required), with additional explanation and
    examples provided in the :ref:`Placing-mag-map-roses` cookbook section. Optionally, use |-F| to place a panel
    behind the magnetic rose.

    - **+w**\ *width* to set the width of the rose in plot coordinates (append **i**\ nch, **c**\ m, or **p**\ oints).
    - **+d**\ *dec*\ [/\ *dlabel*] to assign the magnetic declination and set *dlabel*, which is a label for the
      magnetic compass needle (omit *dlabel* to format a label from *dec*, or give *-* to bypass labeling). With **+d**,
      both directions to geographic and magnetic north are plotted [default is geographic only].
    - **+i**\ *pen* to draw the outline of the inner circle in the specified :ref:`pen <-Wpen_attrib>`.
    - **+j**\ *justify* to set the justification :ref:`anchor point <Anchor_Point_j>`, where *justify* is a 2-character
      :ref:`justification code <Reference_Points>` that is a combination of a horizontal (**L**, **C**, or **R**) and a
      vertical (**T**, **M**, or **B**) code. **Note**: If **j** is used to set the reference point
      then *justify* defaults to the same as *refpoint*; if **J** is used then *justify* defaults to the mirror opposite
      of *refpoint*; if **g**, **n**, or **x** is used to set the reference point then *justify* defaults to **MC**.
    - **+l**\ [*w,e,s,n*] to label the cardinal points W,E,S,N and append your own four comma-separated strings to
      override the default. Skip a specific label by leaving it blank. If the north label is \* then a north star is
      plotted instead of the north label.
    - **+p**\ *pen* to draw the outline of the outer circle in the specified :ref:`pen <-Wpen_attrib>`.
    - **+t**\ *ints* to specify the annotation and two tick interval levels for the geographic and magnetic directions
      by providing three slash-separated intervals. Specify separate intervals by appending three slash-separated
      geographic intervals followed by three slash-separated magnetic intervals [default is **30**/**5**/**1**]
    - **+o**\ *dx*\ [/*dy*] to offset the :ref:`anchor point <Anchor_Point_o>` by *dx* and optionally *dy* (if different
      than *dx*).
