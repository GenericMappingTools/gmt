    Dump the (x,y,z) coordinates of each contour to one or more output files
    (or *stdout* if *template* is not given). No plotting will take place.
    If *template* contains one or more of the C-format specifiers %d, %f, %c
    then line segments will be written to different files; otherwise all
    lines are written to the specified file (*template*). The use of the
    C-format specifiers controls how many files are created and how the
    contours are organized. If the float format %f is present (standard
    modifications to width and precision are allowed, e.g., %f7.3f), then
    the filenames will contain the contour value and lines are thus
    separated into files based on a common contour value. If the integer
    format %d is present (including modifications like %05d), then all
    contours are written to individual segment files; if any of the other
    specifiers are present they just affect the file names. Finally, if the
    character format %c is present it is replaced with the letters C (for
    closed) or O (for open), reflecting the nature of each contour. Any
    combination of one, two, or all three modifiers are valid, resulting in
    different filenames and number of files. For instance, if %c appears by
    itself, then only two files are created, separating the open from the
    closed contours (assuming both kinds are present). If just %f is used,
    then all segments for the same contour level will be written to the same
    file, resulting in *N* multi-segment files. If both %f and %c were
    combined then each contour level would be further subdivided into closed
    and open contours. Any combination involving %d will result in one
    individual file for each segment; %c, %f only modifies the file names.
    The files are ASCII unless **-bo** is used.
