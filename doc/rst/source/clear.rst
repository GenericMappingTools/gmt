Synopsis
--------

.. include:: common_SYN_OPTs.rst_

**gmt clear** **all** \| **cache** \| **data**\ [=\ *planet*\|\ *name*] \| **geography**\ [=\ *name*] \| **sessions** \| **settings**
[ |-N| ]
[ |SYN_OPT-V| ]

|No-spaces|

Description
-----------

The clear command allows users to delete their entire user cache, data, geography, or sessions
directories, and in modern mode their defaults settings (i.e., gmt.conf), or all of the above.

Optional Arguments
------------------

.. _clear-all:

**all**
    Deletes all the items under the control of the individual targets.

.. _clear-cache:

**cache**
    Delete the user's cache directory and all of its contents.

.. _clear-data:

**data**\ [=\ *planet*\|\ *name*]]
    Delete the user's data download server directory and all of its contents.
    Alternatively, append =\ *planet* for a specific planet and we only delete
    data for that sub-directory [all planets]. Finally, you could also just specify
    the *name* for one of them, which leaves the rest intact.

.. _clear-geography:

**geography**\ [=\ *name*]
    Delete the user's geography directory.  Append either *=gshhg* or *=dcw*
    if you only want to delete the named data set [both].

.. _clear-sessions:

**sessions**
    Delete the user's sessions directory.

.. _clear-settings:

**settings**
    Delete the current default settings file (gmt.conf) used for the current modern session.

Optional Arguments
------------------

.. _-N:

**-N**
    Find all the sub directories that need to be remove, but just print them to *stdout*,
    do **not** delete any files.
