Description
-----------

**rose** reads (length, azimuth) pairs from *file* [or standard input]
and plot a windrose diagram.  Add **-i**\ 0 if your file only has azimuth values.
Optionally (with **-A**), polar histograms may be drawn (sector diagram
or rose diagram). Options include full circle and half circle plots. The
outline of the windrose is drawn with the same color as **MAP\_DEFAULT\_PEN**.

Required Arguments
------------------

None.

Optional Arguments
------------------

.. |Add_intables| replace:: If a file with only
    azimuths are given, use **-i** to indicate the single column with
    azimuths; then all lengths are set to unity (see **-Zu** to set
    actual lengths to unity as well).
.. include:: explain_intables.rst_

.. _-A:

**-A**\ *sector_width*\ [**+r**]
    Gives the sector width in degrees for sector and rose diagram.
    [Default 0 means windrose diagram]. Append **+r** to draw rose
    diagram instead of sector diagram.

.. _-B:

.. include:: explain_-B.rst_
|
|   Remember that "x" here is
|   radial distance and "y" is azimuth. The ylabel may be used to plot a figure caption.
|   The scale bar length is determined by the radial gridline spacing.

.. _-C:

**-C**\ *cpt*
    Give a CPT. The r-value for each sector is used to
    look-up the sector color.  Cannot be used with a rose diagram.
    If modern mode and no argument is given then we select the current CPT.

.. _-D:

**-D**
    Shift sectors so that they are centered on the bin interval (e.g.,
    first sector is centered on 0 degrees).

.. _-E:

**-E**\ **m**\|\ [**+w**]\ *mode_file*
    Plot vectors showing the principal directions given in the *mode_file*
    file. Alternatively, specify **-Em** to compute and plot mean direction. See
    **-M** to control the vector attributes.  Finally, to instead save the
    computed mean direction and other statistics, use [**m**]\ **+w**\ *mode_file*.
    The eight items saved to a single record are:
    *mean_az, mean_r, mean_resultant, max_r, scaled_mean_r, length_sum, n, sign@alpha*,
    where the last term is 0 or 1 depending on whether the mean resultant is significant
    at the level of confidence set via **-Q**.

.. _-F:

**-F**
    Do not draw the scale length bar [Default plots scale in lower right corner]

.. _-G:

**-G**\ *fill* :ref:`(more ...) <-Gfill_attrib>`
    Selects shade, color or pattern for filling the sectors [Default is no fill].

.. _-I:

**-I**
    Inquire. Computes statistics needed to specify a useful **-R**. No
    plot is generated.  The following statistics are written to stdout:
    *n*, *mean az*, *mean r*, *mean resultant length*, *max bin sum*,
    *scaled mean*, and *linear length sum*.

.. _-J:

**-JX**\ *diameter*
    Sets the diameter of the rose diagram.  Only this form of the projection machinery
    is supported for this module.  If not given, then we default to a diameter of 7.5 cm.

.. _-L:

**-L**\ [*wlabel*\ ,\ *elabel*\ ,\ *slabel*\ ,\ *nlabel*]
    Specify labels for the 0, 90, 180, and 270 degree marks. For
    full-circle plot the default is WEST,EAST,SOUTH,NORTH and for
    half-circle the default is 90W,90E,-,0. A - in any entry disables
    that label. Use **-L** with no argument to disable all four labels.
    Note that the GMT_LANGUAGE setting will affect the words used.

.. _-M:

**-M**\ *parameters*
    Used with **-E** to modify vector parameters. For vector heads,
    append vector head *size* [Default is 0, i.e., a line]. See VECTOR
    ATTRIBUTES for specifying additional attributes.  If **-E** is not
    given and the current plot mode is to draw a windrose diagram then
    using **-M** will add vector heads to all individual directions
    using the supplied attributes.

.. _-Q:

**-Q**\ [*alpha*]
    Sets the confidence level used to determine if the mean resultant
    is significant (i.e., Lord Rayleigh test for uniformity) [0.05].
    **Note**: The critical values are approximated [Berens, 2009] and
    requires at least 10 points; the critical resultants are accurate
    to at least 3 significant digits.  For smaller data sets you
    should consult exact statistical tables.

.. _-R:

**-R**\ *r0*/*r1*/*az\_0*/*az\_1*
    Specifies the 'region' of interest in (r,azimuth) space. r0 is 0, r1
    is max length in units. For azimuth, specify either -90/90 or 0/180
    for half circle plot or 0/360 for full circle.

.. _-S:

**-S**
    Normalize input radii (or bin counts if **-A** is used) by the largest
    value so all radii (or bin counts) range from 0 to 1.

.. _-T:

**-T**
    Specifies that the input data are orientation data (i.e., have a 180 degree
    ambiguity) instead of true 0-360 degree directions [Default]. We
    compensate by counting each record twice: First as *azimuth* and second
    as *azimuth + 180*.  Ignored if range is given as -90/90 or 0/180.

.. _-U:

.. include:: explain_-U.rst_

.. _-V:

.. |Add_-V| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: explain_-V.rst_

.. _-W:

**-W**\ *pen*
    Set pen attributes for sector outline or rose plot. [Default is no
    outline]. Use **-Wv**\ *pen* to change pen used to draw vector
    (requires **-E**) [Default is same as sector outline].

.. _-X:

.. include:: explain_-XY.rst_

.. _-Z:

**-Z**\ **u**\|\ *scale*
    Multiply the data radii by *scale*. E.g., use **-Z**\ 0.001 to
    convert your data from m to km. To exclude the radii from
    consideration, set them all to unity with **-Zu** [Default is no
    scaling].

**-:**
    Input file has (azimuth,radius) pairs rather than the expected
    (radius,azimuth).
