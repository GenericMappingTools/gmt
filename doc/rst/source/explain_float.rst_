Grid Values Precision
---------------------

Regardless of the precision of the input data, GMT programs that create
grid files will internally hold the grids in 4-byte floating point
arrays. This is done to conserve memory and furthermore most if not all
real data can be stored using 4-byte floating point values. Data with
higher precision (i.e., double precision values) will lose that
precision once GMT operates on the grid or writes out new grids. To
limit loss of precision when processing data you should always consider
normalizing the data prior to processing.
