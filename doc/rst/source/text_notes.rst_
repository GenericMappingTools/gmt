Windows Remarks
---------------

Note that under Windows, the percent sign (%) is a variable indicator
(like $ under Unix). To indicate a plain percentage sign in a batch
script you need to repeat it (%%); hence the font switching mechanism
(@%\ *font*\ % and @%%) may require twice the number of percent signs.
This only applies to text inside a script or that otherwise is processed
by DOS. Data files that are opened and read by the module do not need
such duplication.

Composite Characters
--------------------

If the two characters that are to be combined come from different
fonts (say, Symbol and Times), then it is allowed for the *second*
character (but not the first) to be surrounded by escape codes to
temporarily change the font for that character.  For instance, the
sequence "@!\\227@~\\145@~" will print the epsilon character (octal code
\\145 from the Symbol font) with time-derivative indicated by the
over-printed dot (octal code \\227 from the current font, assuming the
ISOLatin1 character set).

Limitations
-----------

In paragraph mode, the presence of composite characters and other escape
sequences may lead to unfortunate word splitting. Also, if a font is
requested with an outline pen it will not be used in paragraph mode.
Note if any single word is wider than your chosen paragraph width then
the paragraph width is automatically enlarged to fit the widest word.

Use from external interface
---------------------------

When the module is called from external interfaces then we impose the following
condition on the **-F** setting: We require that **+a** (read angle from
input), if specified, must appear before either of **+f** (read font from input) and **+j**
(read justification from input), if these are present.  This is necessary because the
angle is a numerical column while font and justification must be encoded as part of the
trailing text.

Adding more fonts

To add custom fonts, please see :ref:`General Features <non-default-fonts>`.
