    Convert the input *x*-coordinate to a cyclical coordinate, or select another
    column instead via the **+c** modifier.  Append the cycle code of interest.
    If the selected column contains absolute time then you can choose between
    these specific temporal cycles:
    **y** (yearly) converts time to a normalized year (0-1), while
    **a** (annual) converts time to calendar months that are each normalized to 0-1,
    then adds the integer month, yielding coordinates in the 0-12 range.
    Code **w** converts time to 7 repeating weekdays yielding the range 0-7.
    **Note**: Coordinates in the range 0-1 correspond to the
    first day of the week [Monday] but can be changed via :term:`TIME_WEEK_START`.
    Code **d** converts time to a cyclical day with range 0-24 hours,
    **h** converts time to a cyclical hour with range 0-60 minutes,
    **m** converts time to a cyclical minute with range 0-60 seconds, and
    **s** converts time to a cyclical second with range 0-1 seconds.
    Alternatively (and for any type of data) one can also select a custom *period*
    and optional *phase* [0] via the **c** code, which results in normalized data
    in the range 0-1.  **Note**: If a temporal cycle is indicated then we
    implicitly set **-f** to indicate absolute time (unless already set separately).
    See Section :ref:`Examining data cycles: The -w option <option_-w>` for
    more discussion, including examples.
