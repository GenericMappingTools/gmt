The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce new users to GMT,
outline the GMT environment, and enable you to make several
forms of graphics without having to know too much about UNIX
and UNIX tools.  We will not be able to cover all aspects of
GMT nor will we necessarily cover the selected topics in
sufficient detail.  Nevertheless, it is hoped that the exposure
will prompt the users to improve their GMT and UNIX skills
after completion of this short tutorial.
