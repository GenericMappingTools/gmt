    Give one or more combinations for values *xname*, *yname*, *zname* (give the names of those variables
    and in square bracket their units, e.g., "distance [km]"), *scale* (to multiply grid values after
    read [normally 1]), *offset* (to add to grid after scaling [normally 0]),
    *invalid* (a value to represent missing data [NaN]), *title* (anything you
    like), and *remark* (anything you like). Items not listed will remain untouched.
    Give a blank name to completely reset a particular string.
    Use quotes to group texts with more than one word.
    Note that for geographic grids (**-fg**) *xname* and *yname* are set automatically.
