Auto-legend entries
-------------------

This module allows you to use the **-l** option to specify an automatic legend entry.
This option is available for lines or symbols only.  If the symbol size is variable
and computed from other information (which may be true for some symbols deriving their
size from other input columns), then you need to supply a representative legend size
via the **+S** modifier.
