In addition to the GSHHS coastlines, rivers, and borders data built into some
modules (:doc:`/coast`, :doc:`/gmtselect`, :doc:`/grdlandmask`), we offer several
remote global data grids that you can access via our *remote file* mechanism.
The first time you access one of these files we will download the file from
the GMT server and save it to the *server* directory under your GMT user directory (~/.gmt).
We then read the file from there.  Should you have limited space then there
are ways to control how much is downloaded (see below).

Usage
-----

We have processed and reformatted publicly available global relief
grids and standardized their file names.  In GMT, you may access a global relief grid
(or a subset only by using the **-R** option) by specifying the special name

   @earth_relief_\ *rr*\ *u*

where *rr* is a 2-digit integer specifying the grid resolution in the unit *u*, where
*u* is either **d**, **m** or **s** for arc degree, arc minute or arc second, respectively.
The following codes for *rr*\ *u* are supported:

All of these data will, when downloaded, be placed in your ~/.gmt/server directory, with
the SRTM data organized in sub-directories srtm1 and srtm3 within the server directory.

Technical Information
---------------------

As you see, the 30s and lower resolutions are all derivatives of Scripps' SRTM15+V2 grid
(Tozer et al., 2019).  We have downsampled it via Cartesian Gaussian filtering to prevent
aliasing while preserving the latitude-dependent resolution in the original 15 arc sec grid.
The full (6 sigma) filter-widths are indicated in parenthesis. The 3 and 1 arc second data
are the SRTM 1x1 degree tiles from NASA.  When the 15s or lower resolution grids are accessed
the first time we download the entire file, regardless of your selected region (**-R**).
However, for the SRTM tiles we only download the tiles that are inside your selected region
the first time they are referenced. Also note that the 3 and 1 arc second grids only extend
to latitudes ±60˚. The SRTM tiles are only valid over land.  However, when these grids are
accessed as @earth_relief_01s or @earth_relief_03s we will automatically upsample the
@earth_relief_15s grid to fill in the missing ocean values (but only if the region includes
oceanic areas). If you just want the original land-only SRTM tiles you may use @srtm_relief_03s
or @srtm_relief_01s instead. All grids are gridline-registered except the original SRTM15+V2,
here called @earth_relief_15s.

The dimensions above reflect the number of nodes covered by the global grids and the sizes are
the file sizes of the netCDF-4 compressed short int grids, making the files much smaller
than their original source files without any loss of precision.  To improve download speed,
the SRTM tiles are stored as JPEG2000 images on the GMT server due to superior compression,
but once downloaded to your server directory they are converted to short int compressed netCDF4
grids for easier access. This step uses our GDAL bridge and thus requires that you have built GMT with GDAL support
*and* that your GDAL distribution was built with openjpeg support.

Data Space Concerns
-------------------

There are several ways you can control the amount of space taken up by your own server directory:

#. You can set an upper file size limit for download via the GMT default setting
   :term:`GMT_DATA_SERVER_LIMIT`; the default is unlimited.
#. You can remove the entire server directory via gmt :doc:`/clear` data.
#. You can be clever and set up a crontab job that deletes data files you have not
   touched in, say, 6 months (or some other interval).

Offline Usage
-------------

If you anticipate to be without an Internet connection (or a very slow one), you can download
all the remote files prior to losing connection, using the shell script gmt_getremote.sh in
share/tools.  It also allows you to download all the cache files used for examples.
