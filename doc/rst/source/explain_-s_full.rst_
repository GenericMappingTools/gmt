**-s**\ [*cols*][**+a**][**+r**]
    Suppress output of data records whose *z*-value(s) equal NaN [Default
    outputs all records]. By default, we only consider the third data column
    (*cols = 2*).  However, you can append a comma-separated list of all columns
    or column ranges to include in the NaN test (column ranges must be given
    in the format *start*\ [:*inc*]:*stop*, where *inc* defaults to 1 if
    not specified).  All the selected data columns must be NaN to skip the record.
    Append **+a** to skip the record if just one or more of the columns equal NaN.
    Append **+r** to reverse the decision, i.e., only output records that failed the test.
