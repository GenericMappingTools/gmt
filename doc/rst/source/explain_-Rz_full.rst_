.. _-Rz_full:

In case of perspective view **p**, a z-range (*zmin*, *zmax*) can be appended to indicate
the third dimension. This needs to be done only when using the **Jz** option, not when using
only the **p** option. In the latter case a perspective view of the plane is plotted, with
no third dimension.
