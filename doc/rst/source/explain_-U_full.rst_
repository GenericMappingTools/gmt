**-U**\ [*label*][**+c**][**+j**\ *just*][**+o**\ *dx*/*dy*]
    Draw the GMT system time stamp on the plot.
    By appending **+j**\ *just* [BL] and/or **+o**\ *dx/dy* [-54p/-54p], the
    user may specify the justification of the stamp and where the stamp
    should fall on the page relative to lower left corner of the plot.
    For example, **+jBL+o**\ 0/0 will align the lower left corner of the time
    stamp with the bottom left corner of the plot. Optionally, append a
    *label*, or give **+c** which will plot the module command string. The GMT
    parameters :term:`MAP_LOGO`, :term:`MAP_LOGO_POS`,
    :term:`FONT_LOGO` and :term:`FORMAT_TIME_STAMP`
    can affect the appearance; see the :doc:`gmt.conf` man page for details.
    The time string will be in the locale set by the environment variable
    **TZ** (generally local time).
