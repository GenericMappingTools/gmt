**-U**\ [*label*][**+c**][**+j**\ *just*][**+o**\ *dx*/*dy*]
    Draw the GMT Unix System time stamp on the plot.
    By appending **+j**\ *just* and/or **+o**\ *dx/dy*, the
    user may specify the justification of the stamp and where the stamp
    should fall on the page relative to lower left corner of the plot.
    For example, +jBL+o0/0 will align the lower left corner of the time
    stamp with the bottom left corner of the plot [BL]. Optionally, append a
    *label*, or give **+c** which will plot the command string. The GMT
    parameters :ref:`MAP_LOGO <MAP_LOGO>`, :ref:`MAP_LOGO_POS <MAP_LOGO_POS>`,
    :ref:`FONT_LOGO <FONT_LOGO>` and :ref:`FORMAT_TIME_STAMP <FORMAT_TIME_STAMP>`
    can affect the appearance; see the :doc:`gmt.conf` man page for details.
    The time string will be in the locale set by the environment variable
    **TZ** (generally local time).
