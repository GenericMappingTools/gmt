<h2>Introduction</h2>
As of July 27, 2011, the entire gmt5 package and supporting scaffolding is
under version control using the subversion program.  Two kinds of access are given:
Read-only and read/write.  Read-only lets you check out the latest GMT 5
tree, while read/write allows you to check back in your modifications.
Both types will allow you to completely recreate the gmt5 directory tree
that the developers are using and you may even generate the web-examples
and tar archives on your own machine.
<h2>Requirements</h2>
To take full advantage of subversion access you need to have several utilities
installed in your default path.  While most Linux systems come with all of
them preinstalled (assuming you installed all the utilities), commercial Unix
workstations or Mac OS X usually do not and you must install them separately,
either from source of from pre-made packages (Mac OS X user must first install
the developer tools and X11 - the rest can be obtained via fink).  The tools are:
<UL>
<LI><U>svn.</U>  You will not get far if you do not have svn on your system.
<LI><U>gnumake.</U>  You will need to be using a gnu-compatible version of make.
This may be called <U>gnumake</U> or <U>gmake</U> on your system.
<LI><U>ghostscript.</U>  Needed to generate bitmaps from PostScript files.
The ghostscript package should also come with the scripts <U>ps2epsi</U>
and <U>ps2pdf</U> which you also will use.
<LI><U>pdflatex.</U>  Needed to generate the PDF Documentation from the GMT Latex
files..
<LI><U>autoconf.</U>  This tools is needed to generate the configure scripts
from the configure.ac templates.
</UL>
See links below to obtain any of these utilities.
<h2>Initiation of subversion service</h2>
The initial process of starting to use gmt5 with subversion is done by the utility cshell
script <A HREF="newgmtguru">newgmtguru</A>.  However, here we will go through the
steps manually to indicate the process.
<OL>
<LI><B>Make a GMTdev directory.</B>  This directory will contain all GMT development,
including the main GMT directory tree (in which you can work on GMT programs)
as well as previously released versions, e.g., the GMT4.5.7 release.  Those
directories should be treated as read-only; all your GMT-related development should
take place in the GMT tree.  Change directory to where you want to place GMTdev and type<br>
<p>
mkdir GMTdev<br>
<p>
Then cd into the GMTdev directory.<P>
<LI><B>Checkout GMT 5.</B>  To check out GMT 5 via subversion, run
<P>svn checkout svn://gmtserver.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt5<P>
or, for a "trunkless" copy, run
<P>svn checkout svn://gmtserver.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt5/trunk gmt5<P>
which will start copying the entire gmt5 tree from the GMT server - this can take a while
depending on where you are and traffic load.  It is a good time to go for lunch.
Barring any errors or network troubles you should have everything the GMT gurus have
access to in your local directory.  Note: Those who prefer to use git instead of svn
can mirror gmt5 to a local git repository:<P>
git svn clone svn://gmtserver.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt5/trunk gmt5<P>
<LI><B>Tune your environment.</B>  There are a few parameters that need to be set before you
can run any make operations in GMT.  Hopefully, this process can be simplified as more
gurus come online.  For now, cd into gmt5/guru and copy the guruenv.csh to yourname_env.csh
and edit the latter file.  The file has instructions for what you need to do.  When done,
add the relevant section to your .cshrc or .tcshrc files and source them so the changes
will take effect.  Next, copy gmtguru.macros.orig to gmtguru.macros and edit the latter
file.  Again, follow instructions on what to do.<P>
<LI><B>Get Coastlines data sets.</B>  Because the GSHHS coastline files (*.cdf) are themselves created
from more primitive forms and this process is not in subversion, you must install the coastline
files separately. Get the coastlines by anonymous ftp simply by running<br>
<P>
make get_coast
<P>
<LI><B>Do the guru thing.</B>
If you are with me so far, you are ready to compile GMT.  I recommend a full shake-down
which is done by running
<P>
make site
<P>
This command will run svn update (in case something has changed on the server), create
configure scripts, run them, compile and install gmt5, make man pages and documentation,
and convert to HTML.  It does everything short of creating a version link and tarring of
the release.  You will need to look at GNUmakefile for other things you can do. Or otherwise
simply type
<P>
make
<P>
</OL>
<h2>How to contribute changes</h2>
If you make any changes (e.g., fix a bug or correct a typographical error) you will want to
make sure it gets updated on the GMT server.  How this is done depends on your access:
<UL>
<LI><U>Anonymous access</U>.  Since you do not have write permission you must email the
patch or the fix to someone who does.  Most likely you will send it to gmt@soest.hawaii.edu,
and we will merge your change into the subversion database.
<LI><U>Write access</U>.  With write access you can upload the changes yourself.  You need
to know quite a bit more about subversion than the anonymous users does since when you try to
commit your change there may be a conflict.  Conflicts arise when somebody else has checked
in an updated version of the file you are editing before you check in yours.  When you do,
subversion compares your submission to its current version and it if is more recent that your
starting point it may find a conflict and ask you to resolve it manually.  Usually this is
not too hard as subversion will mark the sections in question with <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< and >>>>>>>>>>>>>
markers.  Make the changes if it is obvious or submit manually to gmt@soest.hawaii.edu if
in doubt. To commit changes to the subversion archive, you run (as an example)
<P>
svn commit -m "Fixed error in -G option"
<P>
If successful, the subversion repository in Hawaii is updated and any future subversion update commands
from anywhere will obtain the revised grdview.c file.  For more info, you need to read
parts of the subversion (see references below).
