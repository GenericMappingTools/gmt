.SH NAME
grdtrend \- Fit trend surface to grids and compute residuals
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(grdtrend) IT(grdfile) OPT(N)IT(n_model)[BD(r)] 
[ OPT(D)IT(diff.nc) ] [ GMT_Rgeo_OPT ] [ OPT(T)IT(trend.nc) ] [ GMT_V_OPT ] 
[ OPT(W)IT(weight.nc) ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(grdtrend) reads a 2-D grid file and fits a low-order polynomial
trend to these data by [optionally weighted] least-squares.  The trend surface is 
defined by:
.sp
m1 + m2*x + m3*y + m4*x*y + m5*x*x + m6*y*y + m7*x*x*x + m8*x*x*y + m9*x*y*y + m10*y*y*y.
.sp
The user must specify OPT(N)IT(n_model), the number of model parameters to use; 
thus, OPT(N)IT(4) fits a bilinear trend, OPT(N)IT(6) a quadratic surface, 
and so on.  Optionally, append BD(r) to the OPT(N) option to perform a 
robust fit.  In this case, the program will iteratively reweight the data based on 
a robust scale estimate, in order to converge to a solution insensitive to outliers.  
This may be handy when separating a "regional" field from a "residual" which should 
have non-zero mean, such as a local mountain on a regional surface.
.sp
If data file has values set to NaN, these will be ignored during fitting; if output 
files are written, these will also have NaN in the same locations.

.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(grdfile)
The name of a 2-D binary grid file.
.TP
OPT(N)IT(n_model)[BD(r)]
[BD(r)]IT(n_model) sets the number of model parameters to fit.  Append BD(r) for robust fit.
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
OPT(D)IT(diff.nc)
Write the difference (input data - trend) to the file IT(diff.nc).
#include "explain_-R.txt" 
Using the OPT(R) option will select a subsection of the input grid. If this subsection exceeds the
boundaries of the grid, only the common region will be extracted.
.TP
OPT(T)IT(trend.nc)
Write the fitted trend to the file IT(trend.nc).
#include "explain_-V.txt"
.TP
OPT(W)IT(weight.nc)
If IT(weight.nc) exists, it will be read and used to solve a weighted 
least-squares problem.  [Default:  Ordinary least-squares fit.]  If the robust 
option has been selected, the weights used in the robust fit will be written to 
IT(weight.nc).

.SH REMARKS
The domain of x and y will be shifted and scaled to [-1, 1] and the basis functions are built from 
Legendre polynomials.  These have a numerical advantage in the form of the matrix which must be 
inverted and allow more accurate solutions.  NOTE: The model parameters listed with OPT(V) are 
Legendre polynomial coefficients; they are not numerically equivalent to the m#s in the equation 
described above.  The description above is to allow the user to match OPT(N) with the order of the 
polynomial surface.  See BD(grdmath) if you need to evaluate the trend using the reported coefficients.

.SH EXAMPLES
To remove a planar trend from hawaii_topo.nc and write result in hawaii_residual.nc:
.br
.sp
grdtrend hawaii_topo.nc -N3 -Dhawaii_residual.nc
.br
.sp
To do a robust fit of a bicubic surface to hawaii_topo.nc, writing the result in 
hawaii_trend.nc and the weights used in hawaii_weight.nc, and reporting the progress:
.br
.sp
grdtrend hawaii_topo.nc -N10r -Thawaii_trend.nc -Whawaii_weight.nc -V
