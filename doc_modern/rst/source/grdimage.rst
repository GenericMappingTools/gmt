Description
-----------

**grdimage** reads one 2-D grid file and produces a gray-shaded (or
colored) map by plotting rectangles centered on each grid node and
assigning them a gray-shade (or color) based on the z-value.
Alternatively, **grdimage** reads three 2-D grid files with the red,
green, and blue components directly (all must be in the 0-255 range).
Optionally, illumination may be added by providing a file with
intensities in the (-1,+1) range or instructions to derive intensities
from the input data grid. Values outside this range will be
clipped. Such intensity files can be created from the grid using
:doc:`grdgradient` and, optionally, modified by :doc:`grdmath` or
:doc:`grdhisteq`. A third alternative is available when GMT is build
with GDAL support. Pass *img* which can be an image file (geo-referenced or not).
In this case the images can optionally be illuminated with the
file provided via the **-I** option. Here, if image has no coordinates
then those of the intensity file will be used.

When using map projections, the grid is first resampled on a new
rectangular grid with the same dimensions. Higher resolution images can
be obtained by using the **-E** option. To obtain the resampled value
(and hence shade or color) of each map pixel, its location is inversely
projected back onto the input grid after which a value is interpolated
between the surrounding input grid values. By default bi-cubic
interpolation is used. Aliasing is avoided by also forward projecting
the input grid nodes. If two or more nodes are projected onto the same
pixel, their average will dominate in the calculation of the pixel
value. Interpolation and aliasing is controlled with the **-n** option.

The **-R** option can be used to select a map region larger or smaller
than that implied by the extent of the grid.

Required Arguments
------------------

*grd_z* \| *img* \| *grd_r grd_g grd_b*
    2-D gridded data set (or red, green, blue grids)  or image to be imaged (See
    GRID FILE FORMATS below.)

.. _-J:

.. |Add_-J| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: explain_-J.rst_

Optional Arguments
------------------

.. _-A:

**-A**\ *out_img*\ [**=**\ *driver*]
    Save an image in a raster format instead of PostScript. Use extension .ppm for a Portable
    Pixel Map format. For GDAL-aware versions there are more choices: Append *out_img* to select
    the image file name and extension. If the extension is one of .bmp, .gif, .jpg, .png, or .tif
    then no driver information is required. For other output formats you must append the required
    GDAL driver. The *driver* is the driver code name used by GDAL; see your GDAL installation's
    documentation for available drivers. Append a +c<options> string where *options* is a list of
    one or more concatenated number of GDAL -co options. For example, to write a GeoPDF with the
    TerraGo format use *=PDF+cGEO_ENCODING=OGC_BP*. Notes: (1) If a tiff file (.tif) is selected
    then we will write a GeoTiff image if the GMT projection syntax translates into a PROJ4 syntax,
    otherwise a plain tiff file is produced. (2) Any vector elements will be lost.

.. include:: explain_-B.rst_

.. _-C:

**-C**\ [*cpt* \|\ *master*\ [**+i**\ *zinc*] \|\ *color1,color2*\ [,*color3*,...]]
    Name of the CPT (for *grd_z* only). Alternatively,
    supply the name of a GMT color master dynamic CPT [rainbow] to
    automatically determine a continuous CPT from
    the grid's z-range; you may round up/down the z-range by adding **+i**\ *zinc*.
    Yet another option is to specify **-C**\ *color1*\ ,\ *color2*\ [,\ *color3*\ ,...]
    to build a linear continuous CPT from those colors automatically.
    In this case *color1* etc can be a r/g/b triplet, a color name,
    or an HTML hexadecimal color (e.g. #aabbcc ).

.. _-D:

**-D**\ [**r**]
    GMT will automatically detect standard image files (Geotiff, TIFF,
    JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.) and will read those via GDAL.  For very
    obscure image formats you may need to explicitly set **-D**, which
    specifies that the grid is in fact an image file to be read via
    GDAL. Append **r** to assign the region specified by **-R** to the image.
    For example, if you have used **-Rd** then the image will be
    assigned a global domain. This mode allows you to project a raw image
    (an image without referencing coordinates).

.. _-E:

**-E**\ [\ **i**\ \|\ *dpi*]
    Sets the resolution of the projected grid that will be created if a
    map projection other than Linear or Mercator was selected [100]. By
    default, the projected grid will be of the same size (rows and
    columns) as the input file. Specify **i** to use the PostScript
    image operator to interpolate the image at the device resolution.

.. _-G:

**-G**\ [**f**\ \|\ **b**]\ *color*
    This option only applies when a resulting 1-bit image otherwise would
    consist of only two colors: black (0) and white (255). If so, this
    option will instead use the image as a transparent mask and paint
    the mask with **-Gf** (or its inverse, with **-Gb**) with the given color combination.

.. _-I:

**-I**\ [*intensfile*\ \|\ *intensity*\ \|\ *modifiers*]
    Gives the name of a grid file with intensities in the (-1,+1) range,
    or a constant intensity to apply everywhere; this simply affects the
    ambient light.  If just **+** is given then we derive an intensity
    grid from the input data grid *grd_z* via a call to :doc:`grdgradient`
    using the arguments **-A**\ -45 and **-Nt**\ 1 for that module. You can
    append **+a**\ *azimuth* and **+n**\ *args* to override those values.  If you want
    more specific intensities then run :doc:`grdgradient` separately first.
    [Default is no illumination].

.. include:: explain_-Jz.rst_

.. _-M:

**-M**
    Force conversion to monochrome image using the (television) YIQ
    transformation. Cannot be used with **-Q**.

.. _-N:

**-N**
    Do not clip the image at the map boundary (only relevant for
    non-rectangular maps).

.. _-Q:

**-Q**
    Make grid nodes with z = NaN transparent, using the color-masking
    feature in PostScript Level 3 (the PS device must support PS Level 3).

.. _-R:

.. |Add_-R| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: explain_-R.rst_

.. |Add_-Rz| replace:: You may ask for a larger
    *w/e/s/n* region to have more room between the image and the axes. A
    smaller region than specified in the grid file will result in a
    subset of the grid [Default is the region given by the grid file].

Imaging Grids With Nans
-----------------------

Be aware that if your input grid contains patches of NaNs, these patches
can become larger as a consequence of the resampling that must take
place with most map projections. Because **grdimage** uses the
PostScript colorimage operator, for most non-linear projections we
must resample your grid onto an equidistant rectangular lattice. If you
find that the NaN areas are not treated adequately, consider (a) use a
linear projection, or (b) use :doc:`grdview` **-Ts** instead.

.. include:: explain_grdresample.rst_

Image formats recognized
------------------------

We automatically recognize image formats via their magic bytes.  For formats
that could contain either an image of a data set (e.g., geotiff) we determine
which case it is and act accordingly.  If your favorite image format is not
automatically detected then please let us know its magic bytes so we can add it.
