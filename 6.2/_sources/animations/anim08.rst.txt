(8) One year (2018) of Pacific seismicity events
-----------------------------------------------------

Animation of all simplicity in the Pacific basin during 2018 that exceeded
a threshold of magnitude 5.  We then plot the earthquakes as they occurred on
a map that moves in longitude from west to east, with a deliberate pause near
Longitude 200 so we can watch the near-daily magnitude 5.2 quakes that hit the
Big Island of Hawaii during the 3-month 2018 eruption.  We scale magnitude to
symbol size (spherical circle diameter in km) and announce each quake by magnifying
size and whitening the color for a little bit.  Later the symbols fade to darker
color and smaller sizes but remain for the duration of the movie.

The resulting movie was presented at the Fall 2019 AGU meeting in an eLighting talk:
P. Wessel, 2019, GMT science animations for the masses, Abstract IN21B-11.
The finished movie is available in our YouTube channel as well:

The movie took ~1 hour to render on a 24-core MacPro 2013.
