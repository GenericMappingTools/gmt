<p>GMT uses the <a class="reference internal" href="../coast.html"><span class="doc">coast</span></a> utility to access a version of the GSHHG data
specially formatted for GMT.  The GSHHG data have strengths and weaknesses.
It is global and open source, but is based on relatively old datasets and
hence may not be accurate enough for very large-scale mapping projects.
The current GSHHG version used by GMT is 2.3.7.  Below is a mostly technical
description of how the GSHHG data set was assembled, processed, and formatted
to meet the requirements of GMT.</p>
<div class="section" id="selecting-the-right-data">
<h2>Selecting the right data<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-the-right-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two well-known public-domain data sets that could be used for
this purpose. Once is known as the World Data Bank II or CIA Data Bank
(WDB) and contains coastlines, lakes, political boundaries, and rivers.
The other, the World Vector Shoreline (WVS) only contains shorelines
between saltwater and land (i.e., no lakes). It turns out that the WVS
data is far superior to the WDB data as far as data quality goes, but as
noted it lacks lakes, not to mention rivers and borders. We decided to
use the WVS whenever possible and supplement it with WDB data. We got
these data over the Internet; they are also available on CD-ROM from the
National Centers for Environmental Information in Boulder, Colorado <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id1">1</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="format-required-by-gmt">
<h2>Format required by GMT<a class="headerlink" href="#format-required-by-gmt" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to paint continents or oceans it is necessary that the
coastline data be organized in polygons that may be filled. Simple line
segments can be used to draw the coastline, but for painting polygons
are required. Both the WVS and WDB data consists of unsorted line
segments: there is no information included that tells you which segments
belong to the same polygon (e.g., Australia should be one large
polygon). In addition, polygons enclosing land must be differentiated
from polygons enclosing lakes since they will need different paint.
Finally, we want <a class="reference internal" href="../coast.html"><span class="doc">coast</span></a> to be
flexible enough that it can paint the land <em>or</em> the oceans <em>or</em> both. If
just land (or oceans) is selected we do not want to paint those areas
that are not land (or oceans) since previous plot programs may have
drawn in those areas. Thus, we will need to combine polygons into new
polygons that lend themselves to fill land (or oceans) only (Note that
older versions of <a class="reference internal" href="../coast.html"><span class="doc">coast</span></a> always
painted lakes and wiped out whatever was plotted beneath).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-long-and-winding-road">
<h2>The long and winding road<a class="headerlink" href="#the-long-and-winding-road" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The WVS and WDB together represent more than 100 Mb of binary data and
something like 20 million data points. Hence, it becomes obvious that
any manipulation of these data must be automated. For instance, the
reasonable requirement that no coastline should cross another coastline
becomes a complicated processing step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To begin, we first made sure that all data were “clean”, i.e., that
there were no outliers and bad points. We had to write several
programs to ensure data consistency and remove “spikes” and bad
points from the raw data. Also, crossing segments were automatically
“trimmed” provided only a few points had to be deleted. A few hundred
more complicated cases had to be examined semi-manually.</p></li>
<li><p>Programs were written to examine all the loose segments and determine
which segments should be joined to produce polygons. Because not all
segments joined exactly (there were non-zero gaps between some
segments) we had to find all possible combinations and choose the
simplest combinations. The WVS segments joined to produce more than
200,000 polygons, the largest being the Africa-Eurasia polygon which
has 1.4 million points. The WDB data resulted in a smaller data base
(~25% of WVS).</p></li>
<li><p>We now needed to combine the WVS and WDB data bases. The main problem
here is that we have duplicates of polygons: most of the features in
WVS are also in WDB. However, because the resolution of the data
differ it is nontrivial to figure out which polygons in WDB to
include and which ones to ignore. We used two techniques to address
this problem. First, we looked for crossovers between all possible
pairs of polygons. Because of the crossover processing in step 1
above we know that there are no remaining crossovers within WVS and
WDB; thus any crossovers would be between WVS and WDB polygons.
Crossovers could mean two things: (1) A slightly misplaced WDB
polygon crosses a more accurate WVS polygon, both representing the
same geographic feature, or (2) a misplaced WDB polygon (e.g., a
small coastal lake) crosses the accurate WVS shoreline. We
distinguished between these cases by comparing the area and centroid
of the two polygons. In almost all cases it was obvious when we had
duplicates; a few cases had to be checked manually. Second, on many
occasions the WDB duplicate polygon did not cross its WVS counterpart
but was either entirely inside or outside the WVS polygon. In those
cases we relied on the area-centroid tests.</p></li>
<li><p>While the largest polygons were easy to identify by visual
inspection, the majority remain unidentified. Since it is important
to know whether a polygon is a continent or a small pond inside an
island inside a lake we wrote programs that would determine the
hierarchical level of each polygon. Here, level = 1 represents
ocean/land boundaries, 2 is land/lakes borders, 3 is
lakes/islands-in-lakes, and 4 is
islands-in-lakes/ponds-in-islands-in-lakes. Level 4 was the highest
level encountered in the data. To automatically determine the
hierarchical levels we wrote programs that would compare all possible
pairs of polygons and find how many polygons a given polygon was
inside. Because of the size and number of the polygons such programs
would typically run for 3 days on a Sparc-2 workstation.</p></li>
<li><p>Once we know what type a polygon is we can enforce a common
“orientation” for all polygons. We arranged them so that when you
move along a polygon from beginning to end, your left hand is
pointing toward “land”. At this step we also computed the area of all
polygons since we would like the option to plot only features that
are bigger than a minimum area to be specified by the user.</p></li>
<li><p>Obviously, if you need to make a map of Denmark then you do not want
to read the entire 1.4 million points making up the Africa-Eurasia
polygon. Furthermore, most plotting devices will not let you paint
and fill a polygon of that size due to memory restrictions. Hence, we
need to partition the polygons so that smaller subsets can be
accessed rapidly. Likewise, if you want to plot a world map on a
letter-size paper there is no need to plot 10 million data points as
most of them will plot several times on the same pixel and the
operation would take a very long time to complete. We chose to make 5
versions on the database, corresponding to different resolutions. The
decimation was carried out using the Douglas-Peucker (DP)
line-reduction algorithm <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id5" id="id2">2</a>. We chose the cutoffs so that each
subset was approximately 20% the size of the next higher resolution.
The five resolutions are called <strong>f</strong>ull, <strong>h</strong>igh,
<strong>i</strong>ntermediate, <strong>l</strong>ow, and <strong>c</strong>rude; they are accessed in
<a class="reference internal" href="../coast.html"><span class="doc">coast</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../gmtselect.html"><span class="doc">gmtselect</span></a>, and
<a class="reference internal" href="../grdlandmask.html"><span class="doc">grdlandmask</span></a> with the <strong>-D</strong> option.
For each of these 5 data sets (<strong>f</strong>, <strong>h</strong>, <strong>i</strong>,
<strong>l</strong>, <strong>c</strong>) we specified an equidistant grid (1, 2, 5, 10, 20) and
split all polygons into line-segments that each fit inside one of the
many boxes defined by these grid lines. Thus, to paint the entire
continent of Australia we instead paint many smaller polygons made up
of these line segments and gridlines. Some book-keeping has to be
done since we need to know which parent polygon these smaller pieces
came from in order to prescribe the correct paint or ignore if the
feature is smaller than the cutoff specified by the user. The
resulting segment coordinates were then scaled to fit in short
integer format to preserve precision and written in netCDF format for
ultimate portability across hardware platforms <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id6" id="id3">3</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>While we are now back to a file of line-segments we are in a much
better position to create smaller polygons for painting. Two problems
must be overcome to correctly paint an area:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We must be able to join line segments and grid cell borders into
meaningful polygons; how we do this will depend on whether we want
to paint the land or the oceans.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to nest the polygons so that no paint falls on areas that
are “wet” (or “dry”); e.g., if a grid cell completely on land
contains a lake with a small island, we do not want to paint the
lake and then draw the island, but paint the annulus or “donut”
that is represented by the land and lake, and then plot the
island.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>GMT uses a polygon-assembly routine that carries out these tasks on the fly.</p>

</ul>

<h2>The Five Resolutions<a class="headerlink" href="#the-five-resolutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will demonstrate the power of the new database by starting with a
regional hemisphere map centered near Papua New Guinea and zoom in on a
specified point. The map regions will be specified in projected km from
the projection center, e.g., we may want the map to go from km to km in
the longitudinal and the latitudinal direction.
Also, as we zoom in on the projection center we want to draw the outline
of the next map region on the plot. To do that we use the <strong>-D</strong> option
in <a class="reference internal" href="../basemap.html"><span class="doc">basemap</span></a>.</p>

<h3>The crude resolution (<strong>-Dc</strong>)<a class="headerlink" href="#the-crude-resolution-dc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We begin with an azimuthal equidistant map of the hemisphere centered on
130°21’E, 0°12’S, which is slightly west of New Guinea, near the Strait of
Dampier. The edges of the map are all 9000 km true distance from the
projection center. At this scale (and for global maps) the crude
resolution data will usually be adequate to capture the main geographic
features. To avoid cluttering the map with insignificant detail we only
plot features (i.e., polygons) that exceed 500 km<sup>2</sup> in area.
Smaller features would only occupy a few pixels on the plot and make the
map look “dirty”. We also add national borders to the plot. The crude
database is heavily decimated and simplified by the DP-routine: The
total file size of the coastlines, rivers, and borders database is only
283 kbytes. The plot is produced by the script:</p>

reproduce the dominant geographic features in the region. We cut back on
minor features less than 100 km<sup>2</sup> in area. We still add
national borders to the plot. The low database is less decimated and
simplified by the DP-routine: The total file size of the coastlines,

<p>We continue to zoom in on the map center. In this map, the edges of the
map are all 500 km true distance from the projection center. We abandon
the low resolution data set as it would look too jagged at this scale
and instead employ the intermediate resolution data that faithfully
reproduce the dominant geographic features in the region. This time, we
ignore features less than 20 km<sup>2</sup> in area. Although the script
still asks for national borders none exist within our region. The
intermediate database is moderately decimated and simplified by the
DP-routine: The combined file size of the coastlines, rivers, and
borders now exceeds 3.35 Mbytes. The plot is generated by the script:</p>

<p>The relentless zooming continues! Now, the edges of the map are all 100
km true distance from the projection center. We step up to the high
resolution data set as it is needed to accurately portray the detailed
geographic features within the region. Because of the small scale we
only ignore features less than 1 km<sup>2</sup> in area. The high
resolution database has undergone minor decimation and simplification by
the DP-routine: The combined file size of the coastlines, rivers, and
borders now swells to 12.3 Mbytes. The map and the final outline box are

approximately 40 by 40 km. We call upon the full resolution data set to
portray the richness of geographic detail within this region; no
features are ignored. The full resolution has undergone no decimation
