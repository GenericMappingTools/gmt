 *	14-SEP-2004.  PW: Version 1.3.  Header is now n * 8 bytes (n = 5)
 *			  For use with version 1.3 of GSHHG
 *	2-MAY-2006.  PW: Version 1.4.  Header is now 32 bytes (all int 4)
 *			  For use with version 1.4 of GSHHG
 *	31-MAR-2007.  PW: Version 1.5.  no format change
 *			  For use with version 1.5 of GSHHG
 *	28-AUG-2007.  PW: Version 1.6.  no format change
 *			  For use with version 1.6 of GSHHG which now has WDBII
 *			  borders and rivers.
 *	03-JUL-2008.  PW: Version 1.11. New -I<id> option to pull out a single pol
 *	27-MAY-2009.  PW: Version 1.12. Now includes container polygon ID in header,
 *			  an ancestor ID, and area of the reduced polygon. Works on
 *			  GSHHG 2.0 data.
 *			  Header is now 44 bytes (all 4-byte integers)
 *	24-MAY-2010.  PW: Data version is now 2.1.0. [no change to format]
 *	15-JUL-2011.   PW: Data version is now 2.2.0. [Change in header format to store
 *			  area magnitude and let greenwich be 2-bit flag (0-3)].  Also
 *			  flag WDBII riverlakes with the river flag as used for GSHHG.
 *	15-APR-2012.  PW: Data version is now 2.2.1. [no change to format]
 *	1-JAN-2013.   PW: Data version is now 2.2.2. [no change to format]
 *	1-JUL-2013.   PW: Data version is now 2.2.3. [no change to format]
 *	1-NOV-2013.   PW: Data version is now 2.2.4. [no change to format]
 *	1-MAR-2014.   PW: Data version is now 2.3.0. [no change to format].  This version
 *			  adds new Antarctica coastlines from the Atlas of the Cryosphere (AC) and
 *			  has grounding line as Level = 5 and ice-front line as Level = 6.
 *			  Only use one of those two Levels and consider either to be Level = 1.
 *	1-JUL-2014.   PW: Data version is now 2.3.1. [no change to format]
 *	1-AUG-2014.   PW: Data version is now 2.3.2. [no change to format]

 * The format of binary GSHHG files are simply sequential:
 * [ Item Header 0 ]
 *   [ Point 1 ]
 *   [ Point 2 ]
 *   [ ....... ]
 *   [ Point n0 ]
 * [ Item Header 1 ]
 *   [ Point 1 ]
 *   [ Point 2 ]
 *   [ ....... ]
 *   [ Point n1 ]
 * [ Item Header 2 ]
 * etc etc.
 *
 * Each header is contained in a GSHHG_HEADER struct and each point is contained in a GSHHG_POINT struct.
 * These two structures are defined below, together with the scalefactor that converts micro-degrees to degrees.
