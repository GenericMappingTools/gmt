.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgrdgradient\fP may be used to compute the directional derivative  
in a given direction (OPT(A)),
or the direction (OPT(S)) [and the magnitude (OPT(D))] of the  
vector gradient of the data.
.br
Estimated values in the first/last row/column of output depend on  
boundary conditions (see OPT(L)).
.br
.TP
\fIin_grdfile\fP
2-D grid file from which to compute directional derivative.
(See GRID FILE FORMATS below).
.TP
OPT(G)
Name of the output grid file for the directional derivative.
(See GRID FILE FORMATS below).
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
OPT(A)
Azimuthal direction for a directional derivative; \fIazim\fP is the  
angle in the x,y plane
measured in degrees positive clockwise from north (the +y direction)  
toward east (the +x direction).
The negative of the directional derivative, \-[dz/dx*sin(\fIazim\fP)  
+ dz/dy*cos(\fIazim\fP)], is
found; negation yields positive values when the slope of z(x,y) is  
downhill in the \fIazim\fP direction,
the correct sense for shading the illumination of an image (see  
\fBgrdimage\fP and \fBgrdview\fP) by a
light source above the x,y plane shining from the \fIazim\fP  
direction.  Optionally, supply two azimuths, OPT(A)\fIazim\fP/\fIazim2\fP,
in which case the gradients in each of these directions  
are calculated
and the one larger in magnitude is retained; this is useful for  
illuminating data with two directions of
lineated structures, e.g. OPT(A)\fI0\fP/\fI270\fP illuminates from  
the north (top) and west (left).
.TP
OPT(D)
Find the direction of the gradient of the data.  By default, the  
directions
are measured clockwise from north, as \fIazim\fP in OPT(A) above.   
Append
\fBc\fP to use conventional Cartesian angles measured  
counterclockwise from
the positive x (east) direction.  Append \fBo\fP to report  
orientations (0-180)
rather than directions (0-360).  Append \fBn\fP to add 90 degrees to  
all angles
(e.g., to give orientation of lineated features).
.TP
OPT(E)
Compute Lambertian radiance appropriate to use with \fBgrdimage\fP  
and \fBgrdview\fP.
The Lambertian Reflection assumes an ideal surface that reflects all  
the light that
strikes it and the surface appears equally bright from all viewing  
directions.
\fIazim\fP and \fIelev\fP are the azimuth and elevation of light  
vector. Optionally, supply
\fIambient\fP \fIdiffuse\fP \fIspecular\fP \fIshine\fP which are  
parameters that control the
reflectance properties of the surface. Default values are: \fI0.55\fP/ 
\fI0.6\fP/\fI0.4\fP/\fI10\fP
To leave some of the values untouched, specify = as the new value.  
For example
OPT(E)\fI60\fP/\fI30\fP/\fI=\fP/\fI0.5\fP sets the \fIazim\fP  
\fIelev\fP and \fIdiffuse\fP to 60, 30
and 0.5 and leaves the other reflectance parameters untouched.
Append \fBs\fP to use a simpler Lambertian algorithm. Note that with  
this form
you only have to provide the azimuth and elevation parameters.
Append \fBp\fP to use the Peucker piecewise linear  approximation  
(simpler but faster algorithm;
in this case the \fIazim\fP and \fIelev\fP are hardwired to 315 and  
45 degrees.
This means that even if you provide other values they will be ignored.)
.TP
OPT(L)
Boundary condition \fIflag\fP may be \fIx\fP or \fIy\fP or \fIxy\fP  
indicating data is periodic in range of
x or y or both, or \fIflag\fP may be \fIg\fP indicating geographical  
conditions (x and y are
lon and lat).  [Default uses "natural" conditions (second partial  
derivative normal to edge is zero).]
.TP
OPT(M)
By default the units of \fBgrdgradient\fP are in units_of_z/ 
units_of_dx_and_dy.
However, the user may choose this option to convert dx,dy in degrees of
longitude,latitude into meters, so that the units of \fBgrdgradient\fP are in
z_units/meter.
.TP
OPT(N)
Normalization.  [Default:  no normalization.]  The actual gradients  
\fIg\fP
are offset and scaled to produce normalized gradients \fIgn\fP with a  
maximum
output magnitude of \fIamp\fP.  If \fIamp\fP is not given, default  
\fIamp\fP = 1.
If \fIoffset\fP is not given, it is set to the average of \fIg\fP.   
OPT(N)
yields \fIgn\fP = \fIamp\fP * (\fIg\fP - \fIoffset\fP)/max(abs(\fIg 
\fP - \fIoffset\fP)).
OPT(Ne) normalizes using a cumulative Laplace distribution yielding
\fIgn\fP = \fIamp\fP * (1.0 - exp(sqrt(2) * (\fIg\fP - \fIoffset\fP)/ 
\fIsigma\fP))
where \fIsigma\fP is estimated using the L1 norm of (\fIg\fP -  
\fIoffset\fP) if it is
not given.   OPT(Nt) normalizes using a cumulative Cauchy  
distribution yielding
\fIgn\fP = (2 * \fIamp\fP / PI) * atan( (\fIg\fP - \fIoffset\fP)/ 
\fIsigma\fP)
where \fIsigma\fP is estimated using the L2 norm of (\fIg\fP -  
\fIoffset\fP) if it is
not given.
.TP
OPT(S)
Name of output grid file with scalar magnitudes of gradient vectors.   
Requires OPT(D) but makes OPT(G) optional.

.SH HINTS
If you don't know what OPT(N) options to use to make an intensity file for\"'
\fBgrdimage\fP or \fBgrdview\fP, a good first try is OPT(Ne)0.6.
.br
.sp
If you want to make several illuminated maps of subregions of a large  
data set,
and you need the illumination effects to be consistent across all the  
maps, use
the OPT(N) option and supply the same value of \fIsigma\fP and  
\fIoffset\fP
to \fBgrdgradient\fP for each map.  A good guess is \fIoffset\fP = 0  
and \fIsigma\fP
found by \fBgrdinfo\fP OPT(L2) or OPT(L1) applied to an unnormalized  
gradient grd.
.br
.sp
If you simply need the \fIx\fP- or \fIy\fP-derivatives of the grid, use
\fBgrdmath\fP.
