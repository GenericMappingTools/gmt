OPT(U)
Draw Unix System time stamp on plot.
By adding \fIjust/dx/dy/\fP, the user may specify the justification of the stamp and
where the stamp should fall on the page relative to lower left corner of the plot.
For example, BL/0/0 will align the lower left corner of the time stamp with the lower left corner of the plot.
Optionally, append a \fIlabel\fP, or \fBc\fP (which will plot the command string.).
The \fBGMT\fP parameters \fBUNIX_TIME\fP, \fBUNIX_TIME_POS\fP, and \fBUNIX_TIME_FORMAT\fP can affect the appearance;
see the \fBgmtdefaults\fP man page for details.
The time string will be in the locale set by the environment variable \fBTZ\fP (generally local time).
