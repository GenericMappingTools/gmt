.SH ASCII FORMAT PRECISION
The ASCII output formats of numerical data are controlled by parameters in
your BD(gmt.conf) file.  Longitude and latitude are formatted according to
BD(FORMAT_GEO_OUT), whereas other values are formatted according
to BD(FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT).  Be aware that the format in effect can lead to loss of
precision in the output, which can lead to various problems downstream.  If
you find the output is not written with enough precision, consider switching
to binary output (OPT(bo) if available) or specify more decimals using
the BD(FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT) setting.
