/* Program:	gmt_ogrread.c
 * Purpose:	routine to read files supported by OGR and dumping all vector data of that dataset.
 *
 * The calling syntax is:
 *	s = gmt_ogrread (vector_file);
 *
 *	"s" is a 2D or 3D structure array with fields:
 *
 *	Name:		A string holding the layer name.
 *	wkt:		A string describing the reference system in the Well Known Format.
 *	proj4:		A string describing the reference system as a Proj4 string
 *	BoundingBox:	The 2D dataset BoundingBox as a 2x2 matrix with Xmin/Xmax in first column and Y in second
 *	Type:		Geometry type. E.g. Point, Polygon or LineString
 *	X:		Column vector of doubles with the vector x-coordinates
 *	Y:		Column vector of doubles with the vector y-coordinates
 *	Z:		Same for z when vector is 3D, otherwise empty
 *	Islands:	2 columns matrix with start and ending indexes of the main Ring and its islands (if any).
 *			This only applies to Polygon geometries that have interior rings (islands).
 *	BBgeom:		Not currently assigned (would be the BoundingBox of each individual geometry)
 *	Att_number:	Number of attributes of a Feature
 *	Att_names:	Names of the attributes of a Feature
 *	Att_values:	Values of the attributes of a Feature as strings
 *	Att_types:	Because "Att_values" came as strings, this is a vector with the codes allowing
 *			the conversion into their original data types as returned by OGR_Fld_GetType(hField).
 *			Thus if the code of element n is 2 (OFTReal) Att_values[n] can be converted to double with
 *			atof. See ogr_core.h for the list of codes and their meanings.
 *
 * Now, given the potential complexity of an OGR dataset the "s" structure can be either a 2D or 3D dimensional
 * struct array. On the simpler case of one single layer the structure is 2D. If more layers are present in the
 * dataset, each layer will be stored in each of the planes (pages) of the 3D array.
 * Also, besides the three simpler geometries (Point, LineString & Polygon) we can have also the more complex
 * combinations of MultiPoint|Line|Polygon or even the GeometryCollections. So each plane of the "s" array is
 * organized as in the following example:
 *
 *	F1 [G11 G12 ...   G1N]
 *	F2 [G21 G22 [] ... []]
 *	F3 [G31 [] ....... []]
 *	FM [.................]
 *
 * Each Gij element of the matrix is a "s" structure as describe above. The F1 .. FM are the features collection
 * in the Layer. Because one Feature can have one or many Geometries the array is defined as having as many columns
 * as the maximum number of Geometries in all Features. There are as many rows as Features in the Layer. However,
 * not all fields of the individual Gij are filled. Only those that contain real data. Also, to not waste space
 * and given that the Attributes of all Geometries of a Feature are equal, only the first column Gm1 elements
 * have assigned the "Att_names|values|types". That is, the others are defined but not filled. The same applies
 * to all other matrix elements represented as []. Again, they are defined (they have to be because the matrix
 * must be rectangular) but their members are not filled.
 *
 * One final note regarding the "Islands" struct element. Because we want to keep trace on paternity of interior
 * rings (islands) of a polygon, each one of those interior polygons is appended to the main polygon but separated
 * with one row of NaNs (2 or 3 NaNs depending if vector is 2d or 3D). The "Islands" element contains thus a Nx2
 * matrix with the indexes of the starting and ending positions of the N polygons that were once the Polygon and
 * its interior rings in the OGR model. For Polygons with no islands, "Islands" is an empty ([]) variable.
