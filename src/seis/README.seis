These notes are just preserved for posterity:

Dear colleagues,

psvelomeca is separated into psvelo and psmeca

psmeca plots focal mechanisms.

Modifications :
 - depth is in third column (in order to use the same file with pscoupe)
 - scale is size of beach ball for magnitude 5
   that is scalar moment = 4e+23 dynes.cm
   instead of 1e24 dynes.cm
   The formula used is the one of
       Thorne Lay, Terry C. Wallace,
       Modern Global Seismology,
       Academic Press p.384.

Additions :
  - plot P and T axis
  - plot moment tensor
  - plot events between depth min and max
  - plot events with color of compressive quadrants
    function of depth

psvelo plots velocity ellipses, strain crosses and strain wedges.

It is a part of the GMT supplemental archive, so it can be installed
automatically via install_gmt.

Psmeca plots seismic moment tensor and/or double couples on a map.
Pscoupe plots seismic moment tensor and/or double couples on a
cross-section.
Pspolar plots polarities on the lower half-sphere.
Psvelo plots velocity ellipses, strain crosses, or strain wedges on a map.

For examples, see the directory test/meca.

Comment from Kurt Feigl regarding distribution rights for meca:

April 5, 2013,

Thanks for your message. Yes, I agree that psvelo and psmeca and their derivatives should be
licensed under the Lesser GNU public license. When Genevieve Patau and I wrote the original
code in 1992, we were both government employees of France. I am not aware of any
restrictions on the intellectual property.

Sincerely,

Kurt Feigl
