 * GMT_bcr.c contains interpolation routines based on convolution kernels
 *	(BCR = bi-dimensional convolution routines)
 *
 * Designed to operate with two rows and columns around each edge,
 * to allow derivative computations.
 * Follows the outline in Lancaster and Salkauskas, section 9.3
 * Meant to replace Taylor routines in GMT in version 3.0 of GMT.
 * Significantly simplified and extended for GMT version 4.2.1.
 *
 * Currently supports:
 * - Nearest neighbor "interpolation"
 *   This attaches a weight of 1 to the nearest grid cell only.
 *
 * - Bi-linear interpolation
 *   The weight given to each of the 4 vertices surrounding the interpolation
 *   point is the product of the weight function in x and y direction
 *   (wx and wy) who have the same form and depend on the projected distance
 *   |t| between the interpolation point and each vertex.
 *
 *   wx = 1 - |t|	for 0 <= |t| <= 1
 *	= 0		for 1 <= |t|
 *
 * - B-spline smoothing
 *   This is a smoothing kernel. I.e., the interpolated value directly
 *   at a grid node is not equal to the nodal value. This is because wx(0) < 1.
 *   The convolution kernel spans 16 vertices surrounding the interpolation point.
 *
 *   wx = 1/2 |t|^3 - |t|^2 + 2/3		for 0 <= |t| <= 1
 *	= -1/6 |t|^3 + |t|^2 -2 |t| + 4/3	for 1 <= |t| <= 2
 *	= 0					for 2 <= |t|
 *
 * - Bi-cubic interpolation
 *   This is the preferred option. It provides a smooth interpolation that
 *   is twice differential in both directions. The values at the grid nodes
 *   remain unchanged. The convolution kernel spans 16 vertices surrounding the
 *   interpolation point.
 *
 *   wx = (a+2) |t|^3 - (a+3) |t|^2 + 1		for 0 <= |t| <= 1
 *	= a |t|^3 - 5a |t|^2 + 8a |t| - 4a	for 1 <= |t| <= 2
 *	= 0					for 2 <= |t|
 *   and  a = -1/2
 *
 * Because of the size of the convolution kernels, these routines assume that
 * the grid is padded with appropriate (periodic or natural) boundary conditions.
 *
