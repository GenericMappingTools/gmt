GMT_I_OPT
IT(x_inc) [and optionally IT(y_inc)] is the grid spacing. Optionally, append a suffix
modifier.  BD(Geographical (degrees) coordinates): Append BD(m) to
indicate arc minutes or BD(s) to indicate arc seconds.  If one of the units BD(e), BD(f), BD(k), BD(M),
or BD(n) is appended instead, the increment is assumed to be given in meter, feet, km, Miles, or
nautical miles, respectively, and will be converted to the equivalent degrees longitude at
the middle latitude of the region (the conversion depends on BD(PROJ_ELLIPSOID)).  If /IT(y_inc) is given but set to 0 it will be reset equal to
IT(x_inc); otherwise it will be converted to degrees latitude.  
BD(All coordinates): If BD(=) is appended then
the corresponding max IT(x) (IT(east)) or IT(y) (IT(north)) may be slightly adjusted to fit exactly the given increment
[by default the increment may be adjusted slightly to fit the given domain].  Finally, instead
of giving an increment you may specify the IT(number of nodes) desired by appending BD(+) to
the supplied integer argument; the increment is then recalculated from the number of nodes and the domain.
The resulting increment value depends on whether you have selected a gridline-registered
or pixel-registered grid; see Appendix B for details.  Note: if OPT(R)IT(grdfile) is used then
the grid spacing has already been initialized; use OPT(I) to override the values.
