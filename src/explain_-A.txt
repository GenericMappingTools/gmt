GMT_A_OPT
Features with an area smaller than IT(min_area) in km^2 or of hierarchical level
that is lower than IT(min_level) or higher than IT(max_level)
will not be plotted [Default is 0/0/4 (all features)].  Level 2 (lakes) contains
regular lakes and wide river bodies which we normally include as lakes;
append BD(+r) to just get river-lakes or BD(+l) to just get regular lakes.
Finally, append BD(+p)IT(percent) to exclude polygons whose percentage area of
the corresponding full-resolution feature is less than IT(percent).
See GSHHS INFORMATION below for more details.
