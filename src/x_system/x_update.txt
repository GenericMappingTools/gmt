.SH NAME
\fBx_update\fP \- Archiving of Cross-Over Information
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx_update\fP \fIcross-overfile\fP [ OPT(X)\fIxbase\fP ] [ OPT(L)\fIlegbase\fP ] 
[ OPT(V) ] [ OPT(W)\fImax\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx_update\fP reads the ASCII file produced by \fBx_over\fP and writes the information to the
database files \fIxx_base.b\fP and \fIxx_legs.b\fP (unless other filenames are specified on the command
line) using a compact, binary format. The options recognized are:
.TP
OPT(X)
Indicate alternate \fIxx_base.b\fP file.
.TP
OPT(L)
Indicate alternate \fIxx_legs.b\fP file.
#include "explain_-V.txt"
Reports the pair currently being processed.
.TP
OPT(W)
Prints a warning if the number of COEs generated by any pair of legs exceed
\fImax\fP.
.SH BEWARE
For security reasons the \fIxx_legs.b\fP are first renamed to \fIxx_legs.b_old\fP, to prevent loss of
information if a black-out or system crash should occur during writing of the new \fIxx_legs.b\fP
file. It is recommended that the old file is left on the disk in case of other disasters. Note that
\fBx_update\fP does not check if a pair of legs already exist in the \fIxx_base.b\fP file. It is the user's\"'
responsibility to ensure that duplication of information does not occur. Should some pairs
already in the database need to be re-examined, then run \fBx_remove\fP which will wipe out all
traces of the specified cruises from the x_system data base files. Now we can pass the pairs that
need to be redone through \fBx_over/x_update\fP again.
