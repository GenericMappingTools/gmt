.SH NAME
\fBx_system\fP \- A Cross-Over Error Analysis Tool
.SH INTRODUCTION
	The \fBx_system\fP was developed to aid in the task of gridding geophysical track data, e.g.
gravity, magnetics, or bathymetry. It has long been recognized that although the data quality
along track may be quite good, one usually finds discrepancies at the points where two tracks
intersect. These cross-over errors (COE) can be large enough to cause artificial features in the
final gridded dataset, which would render geological interpretations of such a map questionable.
Also, notoriously bad cruises will generate high COEs along their tracks, and should ideally be
removed from the data base before gridding is attempted. The reasons why COEs arise are many
and will not be dealt with here. Although originally intended to be used for marine gravity data
only, \fBx_system\fP has been designed to handle magnetics and bathymetry as well. (For an
overview of gravity COEs, see Wessel and Watts [1988]). In most cases, marine gravity COEs
can be explained by a simple model having only 2 parameters. These are a d.c.-shift and a
drift-rate that apply for the duration of the cruise. The goal of the COE analysis is thus to
determine the dc-shifts and drift-rates for each leg that will minimize the COEs in a least squares
sense, and at the same time flag cruises that exhibit unreasonably high COEs (even after
correction for d.c.-shift/drift). Furthermore, we can also assign a 'quality index' for each cruise by
looking at the standard deviation of the COEs. The d.c.-shift/drift rate model may not be as
meaningful for magnetics and bathymetry as it is for gravity. However, looking for high COEs is
still one of the best ways of identifying systematic errors in the magnetic/bathymetric data sets.
.SH x_system PHILOSOPHY
	Since the d.c.-shift/drift corrections for a given cruise depend entirely on the  values of the
COEs generated at intersections with other cruises, there is no such thing as a 'final correction'
as long as we keep on adding data to the data base. This means that the system must be able to
incorporate new data and compute a new set of d.c.-shifts/drift-rates that takes the new COEs into
account. \fBx_system\fP is made modular so that one program computes the actual COEs, one
program archives the COE information, and the remaining programs do various tasks like
reporting statistics (to flag bad cruises), extracting a subset of the COE database, and solving for
the best fitting d.c.-shift/drift corrections. This way only the new COEs generated need to be
computed and added to the database before a new correction solution is sought.
.br
	All the 8 programs that make up the \fBx_system\fP package have been written in the C
programming language and are intended to be run on a UNIX machine. Thus, it is assumed that
the user has access to UNIX tools like \fIawk, grep\fP, and \fIsort\fP, and that the operating system
provides a means for redirecting input/output. Likewise, it is assumed that all the geophysical
data are stored in the GMT-format as outlined in the \fBGMT\fP MGG supplements man pages, and
that the 1 by 1 degree bin information files (gmtindex.b and gmtlegs.b) have been created and are
being maintained by the database librarian.
.SH HOW TO DO IT
	To illustrate how one would set things up, we will go through the necessary steps and
point out usage, useful tricks, and pitfalls. (A more complete description of what exactly each
program does can be found in the man pages for each program).
We will assume that we initially have N cruises in our GMT data bank, and that we just have
received the \fBx_system\fP package. The first thing to do is to run \fBx_init\fP which will create an
empty data base system. This will normally be done only once. 
With N cruises on our hands we will in the worst case have to compare the N*(N+1)/2
possible pairs. This is where \fBx_setup\fP comes in handy. It will read the 1 by 1 degree bin
information files and print out a list of pairs that need to be checked. The two cruises that make
up a pair will at least once occupy the same 1 by 1 degree bin, and may thus intersect. Those
combinations which do not have any bins in common obviously don't have to be checked. Let's
call this list of pairs xpairs.lis.
.br
	\fBx_over\fP is the main program in the package as it is responsible for locating and computing
the COEs  For details on algorithm, see Wessel [1989]. It takes two cruise names as arguments and 
writes out all the COEs generated between
them (if any). Since xpairs.lis may contain quite a few pairs, the most efficient way of running
\fBx_over\fP is to create an executable command (batch) file that starts \fBx_over\fP for each pair.
Using awk to do this, we would say:
.br
.sp
	pratt% awk '{ printf "x_over -<options> %s %s\\n", $1, $2}' xpairs.lis > xjob
.br
	pratt% chmod +x xjob	(make it executable)
.br
	pratt% xjob > xjob.d &
.br
.sp
and relax while xjob is crunching the numbers. This is the time-consuming part of the COE
analysis, and on a SUN-3 computer with Floating Point Accelerator installed we average about
10,000 pairs of cruises/day. It may pay off to split a huge xjob file into smaller parts, and call the
output files xjob.d1, xjob.d2 etc. Most of the run-time is taken up by reading the GMT files;
when in memory the actual computations are remarkably fast. The output file xjob.d will now
have all the COE information in ASCII form. For each pair of legs there will be a header record
stating the names of the cruises and their starting years. The following records up to the next
header record (or End-Of-File) will contain lat, lon, time, value, etc. for each COE found. This is
a temporary file, but it is wise to back it up to tape just in case.
.br
	When the \fBx_over\fP part is done, time has come to archive the data more efficiently than
ASCII files. This is done by \fBx_update\fP which rearranges the data and updates the binary data
base system. After this step the xjob.d files can be deleted (presuming they have been backed up
to tape).  At this stage we have several options available. We can list some of the COEs by running
\fBx_list\fP, which will extract COEs that match the options we pass, e.g. we might ask for all the
internal COEs for cruise c2104, and only print out time and gravity COE. See the man pages for more
details. \fBx_report\fP can be run, and will output statistics for separate cruises, i.e. mean and
standard deviation of the COEs for different data sets (gravity/magnetics/bathymetry). To solve
for the best fitting corrections we would run \fBx_solve_dc_drift\fP. This program will
solve for the d.c.-shift/drift-rates for all cruises, update that information in the data base system,
and create correction tables (ASCII and/or binary). We have now completed the COE analysis for
our initial GMT data bank.
.br
	At some later time, however, we will get a new batch of cruises. We will then follow the
the same recipe and go back and run \fBx_setup\fP, but this time we will use the OPT(L) option so that only the
pairs involving new cruises are returned. Then we would run the remaining programs exactly as
described above.
