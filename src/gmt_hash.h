 *			GMT HASH STRUCTURE DEFINITION
 *--------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/* To avoid lots of dynamic memory allocation for the hash lookup tables we
 * use a statically allocated structure.  By determining that the max number
 * of identical hash numbers across all the keywords is 16, we simply allocate
 * space for 16 entries for each structure.  Should later additions to GMT's
 * default parameters, colornames, etc increase this value we will be warned
 * and can change the entry GMT_HASH_MAXDEPTH below accordingly.
 */
#define GMT_HASH_MAXDEPTH	16

/*! Used to relate text keywords to array indices */
struct GMT_HASH {
	unsigned int id[GMT_HASH_MAXDEPTH];	/* Indices of corresponding keyword with identical hash value */
	unsigned int n_id;			/* Number of hash entries for this item */
	char *key[GMT_HASH_MAXDEPTH];		/* Name of these entries */
};
