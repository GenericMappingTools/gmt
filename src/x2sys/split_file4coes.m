function split_file4coes(fname, n_int)
% Read the output of x2sys_cross -C<file> option and split it into N_INT files
%
% The rationale of this is that running x2sys_cross over a large number of files takes
% a lot of time and the problem is not easily parallelizable. An alternate solution is
% to split the main process into a series of sub-processes and launch each one at a
% different process of your multi-core machine. One could do a rough division by dividing
% by an equally number of lines of the FNAME file, but that is normally not good enough
% because run tine is proportional to the tracks cruises size and not on the number of them.
% An extra bonus is that we will also get rid of cruise pairs that are close enough to
% to have crossed, but actually do not cross. So, by knowing this (it's in the FNAME file),
% we don't need to waste time with such cases anymore.
%
% FNAME		Is the file name given to the -C option. It contains 4 columns.
%			First two hold the names of the pair of cruises whose COEs were under analysis
%			Third column has the number of cross-overs and Forth column the time taken
%			to compute all COEs of that pair. [Default 'runtimes.dat']
%
% N_INT		Is the number of sub-files that the FNAME file will be split [Default 8]
%			The sub-files are created in the same directory as FNAME and have name stem
%			of 'cruzados_%d.txt', e.g. cruzados_5.txt
