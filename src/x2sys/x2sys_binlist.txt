.SH NAME
x2sys_binlist \- Create bin-index files from track data files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP \fItrack(s)\fP [ OPT(T)\fITAG\fP ] 
[ OPT(D) ] [ OPT(E) ] [ GMT_V_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP reads one or more track data files and produces a
multi-segment ASCII track bin-index file (tbf) with the track id in the header and
one data record per bin crossed; these records contain \fIlon, lat, index, flags\fP[, \fIdist\fP],
where \fIlon, lat\fP is the coordinates of the center of the bin, the \fIindex\fP is
the 1-D number of the bin, and \fIflags\fP is a bitflag that describes which data
fields were available in each bin.  The optional \fIdist\fP requires OPT(D).
The input files can be of any format, which must be described and passed with the
OPT(T) option.  The bin-index listing is a crude representation of where
the track goes and is used by the data archivist to build a track data base for
track queries such as to determine which tracks
need to be compared for crossover analysis.  You must run \fBx2ys_init\fP
to initialize the tag before you can run the indexing.

.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-D
Calculate the length of trackline segments per bin [Default skips this step].
The length fragments are given as the 5th output column (after the \fIflags\fP).
.TP
.B \-E
Convert data to a cylindrical equal-area projection prior to binning.  Basically, we
apply the projection OPT(JY)\fIlon0\fP/37:04:17.166076/360, where \fIlon0\fP is the
mid-longitude of the region.  Requires OPT(D), geographical data, and a global region
(e.g., OPT(Rg) or OPT(Rd)).
.TP
.B \-T
Sets the data set \fITAG\fP which among other things sets the definition file.

.SH EXAMPLES
To create a bin index table from the MGD77 file 01030061.mgd77 using a global, 1x1 degree bin system, do
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP 01030061.mgd77 \fB\-T\fPMGD77 > 01030061.tbf
.br
.sp
To create a track bin index file of all MGD77+ files residing in the current directory at a bin resolution
of 30 x 30 minutes ad calculating track distances, run
.br
.sp
\fBx2sys_binlist\fP *.nc \fB\-T\fPMGD77+ \-D\fP > all.tbf
