This package contains seven programs that may be useful
to people who work with Plate Tectonic Reconstructions.
The eight programs are

	backtracker  - Move points back/forth in time
	grdpmodeler  - Create gridded predictions from plate models
	grdrotater   - Reconstruct data grids using finite rotations
	grdspotter   - Create CVA grids using grids of bathy/faa
	hotspotter   - Create CVA grids using seamount locations
	originater   - Associate seamounts with hotspot point sources
	polespotter  - Find stage poles from fracture zones and abyssal hills
	rotconverter - Manipulate finite and stage rotations

Documentation via RST files produce HTML, MAN, and PDF pages that
give full description of the program interfaces.
Furthermore, example scripts (UNIX shell and DOS batch) are
provided which demonstrate how to use the programs on the
enclosed data set and Euler poles.  Note the GMT test/spotter
directory contains additional example of spotter usage.
