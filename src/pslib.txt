.SH NAME
pslib 4.3 \- A \fIPostScript\fP based plotting library
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBpslib\fP\fR was created to make the generation of \fIPostScript\fR page
description code easier.  It is a library that contains a series of tools
that can be used to create plots.  The resulting \fIPostScript\fR code is
ASCII text and can be edited using any text editor.  Thus, it is fairly easy
to modify a plot file even after it has been created, e.g., to change text
strings, set new gray shades or colors, experiment with various pen widths, etc.
\fBpslib\fP\fR is written in C but now includes FORTRAN bindings (thanks to John Goff, WHOI)
and can therefore be called from both C and FORTRAN programs.  To use this library, you must link your plotting program with
pslib.a.  \fBpslib\fP\fR is the core of the \fBGMT\fP\fR
graphics programs.  \fBpslib\fP\fR output conforms to the Adobe Encapsulated
\fIPostScript\fP File Specification Version 3.0 (EPSL), and may be used as EPS
files and inserted into, say, a Word document on a Mac.  See Appendix F in the
Technical Reference for detailed instructions.
.LP
Before any \fBpslib\fP\fR calls can be issued, the plotting system must be
initialized.  This is done by calling \fBps_plotinit\fP (or \fBps_plotinit_hires\fP), which defines macros, sets up
the plot-coordinate system, scales, and [optionally] opens a file where all the
\fIPostScript\fR code will be written.  Normally, the plot code is written
to \fIstdout\fP.  The measure unit for sizes and positions can be set to be centimeter (c),
inch (i), or meter (m).  When all plotting is done, you must terminate the plotting system
by calling \fBps_plotend\fP.
.LP
\fBpslib\fP uses the direct color model where red, green, and blue are given separately,
each must be in the range from 0-255.  If red < 0 then no fill operation takes place.
Most plot-items can be plotted
with or without outlines.  If outline is desired (i.e., set to 1), it
will be drawn using the current linewidth and pattern. \fBpslib\fP\fR uses highly
optimized macro substitutions and scales the coordinates depending on the resolution
of the hardcopy device so that the output file is kept as compact as possible.
.LP
A wide variety of output devices that support \fIPostScript\fR exist, including laserwriters
(color or monochrome) and workstations running \fIPostScript\fR based window systems
like Sun's OpenWindows.  xnews (part of OpenWindows) or ghostscript (public domain) can be used to create rasterfiles at a\"'
user-defined resolution (DPI), making it possible to render \fIPostScript\fR on a Versatec
and other non-\fIPostScript\fR raster devices.  Regular Sun rasterfiles created under NeWS
from \fIPostScript\fR files can be sent to a variety of color hardcopy units.  Check
the devices available on your network.
.LP
The \fBpslib\fP\fR is now fully 64-bit compliant.  However, only a few function parameters
are affected by this (such as the number of point in an array which can now be a 64-bit
integer).  These few parameters are here given the type \fBlong\fP to distinguish them
from \fBint\fP.  Note that under standard 32-bit compilation they are equivalent.  Users
of this library under 64-bit mode must make sure they pass proper \fBlong\fP variables
(under Unix flavors) or \fB__int64\fP under Windows 64.
.SH FUNCTION CALLS
.LP
The following is a list of available functions and a short description of what they do and what
parameters they expect.  All floating point variables are expected to be \fBdouble\fP (i.e.,
8 bytes), whereas all integers are assumed to be 4 bytes long.  All plotting functions are
declared as functions returning an int.  Currently, the return value is undefined.

.br
\fBdouble\fR \fIx, y, radius, angle1, angle2\fP;
.br
\fBint\fR \fIstatus\fP;
.RS 10
Draws a circular arc centered on (\fIx,y\fP) from angle \fIangle1\fP to \fIangle2\fP.
Angles must be given in decimal degrees.  If angle1 > angle2, a negative arc is
drawn.  \fIstatus\fP is a value from 0 through 3.  1 means set new anchor point, 2 means
stroke the circle, 3 means both, 0 means none of the above.

\fBchar\fR \fI*label\fP;
.RS 10
Plots an axis with tickmarks, annotation, and label.  \fIxpos, ypos\fP, and \fIlength\fP
are in inches (or cm or meters), \fIannotpointsize\fP in points (72 points = 1 inch), else
data units are used.  \fIside\fP can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, which selects lower x-axis, right y-axis,
upper x-axis, or left y-axis, respectively.  labelpointsize = 1.5 * \fIannotpointsize\fP.
A negative \fItickval\fP will reverse the sense of positive direction, e.g., to have the
y-axis be positive down.

.RS 10
Sets up a user-definable clip path.  Plotting outside this polygon will be clipped
until \fBps_clipoff\fP is called.  If \fIred\fP >= 0 the inside of the path is
filled with the specified color.  \fIflag\fP is used to create complex clip paths
consisting of several disconnected regions, and takes on values 0-3. \fIflag\fP = 1
means this is the first path in a multi-segment clip path.  \fIflag\fP = 2 means
this is the last segment.  Thus, for a single path, \fIflag\fP = 3.

.br
\fBunsigned char\fR \fIbuffer[]\fP;
.br
\fBint\fR \fInx, ny, depth\fP;
.RS 10
Plots a 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, or 24-bit deep image.
This functions sets up a call to the \fIPostScript\fP colorimage or image operators.
\fIxpos, ypos, xlength, ylength\fP specify the position of lower left corner and size (in inches) of image.
The pixel values are stored in \fIbuffer\fP, an unsigned character array in scanline orientation with gray shade or r/g/b
values (0 - 255) where 0 is black, 255 is white.  \fIbuffer[0]\fP is upper left corner.
\fIdepth\fP is number of bits per pixel (24, 8, 4, 2, or 1).
\fInx,ny\fP refers to the number of pixels in image.
The rowlength of \fIbuffer\fP must be an integral number of 8/\fIdepth\fP.
E.g. if \fIdepth\fP = 4, then \fIbuffer[j]\fP/16
gives shade for pixel[2j-1] and \fIbuffer[j]\fP%16 (mod 16) gives shade for pixel[2j].
When \fI-depth\fP is passed instead then "hardware" interpolation of the image is requested.
If \fI-nx\fP is passed then the first three bytes of \fIbuffer\fP holds the r/g/b color
for pixels that are to be masked out using the \fIPostScript\fP Level 3 Color Mask method.
See the Adobe Systems \fIPostScript\fP\fR Reference Manual for more details.

.RS 10
Similar to \fBps_polygon\fP, but fills the area with an image pattern rather than a color
or grayshade.  \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP hold the arrays of \fIn\fP points.  90 predefined
patterns are available  (See \fBGMT\fP Appendix E).  \fIimage\fP gives the image number (1-90).  If set to 0,
\fIimagefile\fP must be the name to the user's image, which must be stored as a\"'
Sun 1-, 8-, or 24-bit rasterfile.
.br
1-bit images only:
(i) The set pixels (1) are colored using the RGB combination in \fIf_rgb\fP,
while the unset pixels (0) are painted with \fPb_rgb\fP.
Set the f_rgb[0] to -1 to make set pixels transparent.
Set b_rgb[0] to -1 to make the unset pixels transparent.
(ii) If \fIinvert\fP is TRUE (1), the set and unset pixels are interchanged before plotting. 
.br
The unit size of the image is
controlled by \fIdpi\fP (in dots-per-inch).  If set to zero, the image is plotted at the device
resolution.  If \fIoutline\fP is TRUE, the current penwidth is used to draw the
polygon outline.

.RS 10
Plots a 1-bit image using the given foreground color \fIf_rgb\fP and background color \fIb_rgb\fP.
Specify position of lower left corner and size (in inches) of image.  \fIbuffer\fP
is an unsigned character array with 8 pixels per byte.  \fInx,ny\fP
refers to the number of pixels in image.  The rowlength of \fIbuffer\fP must
be an integral number of 8.  \fIbuffer\fP[0] is upper left corner.  \fIbuffer\fP
values are stored as columns, starting at the lower left corner and ending at
the upper right corner.  If \fIinvert\fP is 0 then the bits that are 1 are
painted with the foreground color, while bits that are 0 are painted with the
backgound color.  If \fIinvert\fP is 1, foreground and background are switched.
To get a partly transparent image, set the first index of the foreground or
background color to -1, i.e. f_rgb[0]=-1 or b_rgb[0]=1.

Draw a continuous line from the positions in the x-y arrays.  If \fIclose\fP == 1,
the first and last point will automatically be closed by the \fIPostScript\fP driver.
If this is the first segment in a multi-segment path, set \fItype\fP == 1.  To end
the segments and have the line(s) drawn,  set \fItype\fP == 2.  Thus, for a single
segment, \fItype\fP must be 3.  The line is drawn using the current penwidth.
Only if \fIsplit\fP is TRUE may ps_line use multiple strokes to draw lines longer that MAX_PATH.
ps_polygon will call ps_line with \fIsplit\fP = FALSE since the path must be continuous.
If \fIsplit\fP is FALSE and the pathlength exceeds MAX_PATH a warning will be issued.

Initializes the plotting.  If \fIplotfile\fP == NULL (or ""), then output is sent to \fIstdout\fP,
else output is sent to \fIplotfile\fP.  \fIoverlay\fP should be 1 only if you plan to append
it to some existing \fIPostScript\fP\fR file.  \fImode\fP contains three flags in the three lowest
bits.  The lowest bit controls the plot orientation and can be 0 (Landscape) or 1 (Portrait).  The
next bit, if set to 1, will re-encode the fonts to include European accented characters using the
now-obsolete \fBGMT\fP 3.4 encoding.  To use the ISOLatin1 encoding set the 5th bit to 1.  The third
bit controls the format used to write \fIPostScript\fP images: 0 means binary, 1 means hexadecimal.  Most
printers needs the latter while some can handle binary which are 50% smaller and therefore execute
faster.
\fIxoff,yoff\fP are used to move the origin from the default position in the lower left corner.
\fIxscl,yscl\fP are used to scale the entire plot (Usually set to 1.0, 1.0).  Set \fIncopies\fP to get
more than 1 copy.  \fIdpi\fP sets the hardcopy resolution in dots pr units.  For optimum plot
quality and processing speed, choose \fIdpi\fP to match the intended plotter resolution.  Examples are
300 for most laserwriters, 2540 for Linotype-300, and ~85 for Sun screens.  When in
doubt, use 300.  \fIunit\fP can be any of 0 (cm), 1 (inch), or 2 (m), telling the plot system
what units are used for distance and sizes.  Note that, regardless of choice of unit, dpi is still in
dots-pr-inch.  \fIpagesize\fP means the physical width and height of the plotting media in points, (typically 612 by 792 for
Letter or 595 by 842 for A4 laserwriter plotters.  The \fIrgb\fP array holds the color of the page (usually white = 255,255,255).
The \fIencoding\fP is the name of a character encoding scheme to be used, e.g., Standard, ISOLatin1, ISO-8859-2, etc.
The EPS structure is defined in the pslib.h include file and contains information that will make up the comments header of a EPS file.
Programmers who plan to call pslib routines should read the comments in pslib.h first.  Note that the FORTRAN binding does not
expect this last argument.

void \fBps_setformat\fR (\fIn_decimals\fP)

\fBint\fR \fIn_decimals\fP;
.RS 10
Sets number of decimals to be used when writing color or gray values.  The default
setting of 3 gives 1000 choices per red, green, and blue value, which is more than
the 255 choices offered by most 24-bit platforms.  Choosing a lower value will make
the output file smaller at the expense of less color resolution.  Still, a value of 2
gives 100 x 100 x 100 = 1 million colors, more than most eyes can distinguish.  For
a setting of 1, you will have 10 nuances per primary color and a total of 1000 unique
combinations.

The box represents the textstring.  E.g., to plot a textstring with its center of gravity
at (\fIx,y\fP), you must use \fIjustify\fP == 6.  If \fIjustify\fP is negative, then all leading and trailing
blanks are stripped before plotting.  Certain character sequences (flags) have special
meaning to ps_text. @~ toggles between current font and the Mathematical Symbols font.
@%\fIno\fP% sets font to \fIno\fP; @%% resets to starting font.
@- turns subscript on/off, @+ turns superscript on/off, @# turns small caps
on/off, and @\\ will make a composite character of the following two character.
@;\fIr/g/b\fP; changes the font color (@;; resets it), @:\fIsize\fP: changes the font size (@:: resets it),
and @_ toggles underline on/off.
Give fontsize in points (72 points = 1 inch).  Normally, the text is typed using solid characters.
To draw outline characters, set \fIform\fP == 1.  If \fIpointsize\fP is negative it means
that the current point has already been set before \fBps_text\fP was called and that
(\fIx,y\fP) should be ignored.

This function is used in conjugation with \fBps_text\fP when a box surrounding the
text string is desired.  Taking most of the arguments of \fBps_text\fP, the user must
also specify the color of the resulting rectangle, and whether its outline should
be drawn.  More room between text and rectangle can be obtained by setting \fIdx\fP

Typesets paragraphs of text.  \fItext\fP is an array of the words to typeset, using the given
line-spacing and paragraph width.  The whole text block is positioned at \fIx, y\fP which is
the anchor point on the box as indicated by \fIjustify\fP (see ps_text). The whole block
is then shifted by \fIx_off, y_off\fP. Inside the box, text
is justified left, centered, right, or justified as governed by \fIpar_just\fP (lcrj).
\fIdraw_box\fP contains 4 bit flags pertaining to the surrounding outline box.  If on, the first
(lowest) bit draws the box outline.  The second bit fills the box interior.  The third bit
makes the outline box have rounded corners (unless \fIx_gap, y_gap\fP, which specifies the
padding between the text and the box, are zero), while the forth bit draws a line from the original
\fIx, y\fP point to the shifted position.  The escape sequences described for ps_text applies as well.
