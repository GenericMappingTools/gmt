.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(greenspline) uses the Green's function G(\fBx\fP; \fBx'\fP) for the chosen spline and geometry to interpolate data
at regular [or arbitrary] output locations.  Mathematically, the solution is composed as
IT(w)(BD(x)) = sum {\fIc\fP(\fIi\fP) G(\fBx'\fP; \fBx\fP(\fIi\fP))}, for \fIi\fP = 1, \fIn\fP, the number\"'
of data points {BD(x)(IT(i)), IT(w)(IT(i))}.  Once the IT(n) coefficients IT(c)(IT(i))
have been found then the sum can be evaluated at any output point BD(x).
Choose between ten minimum curvature, regularized, or continuous curvature splines in tension for
either 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D Cartesian coordinates or spherical surface coordinates. After first removing a linear or planar trend
(Cartesian geometries) or mean value (spherical surface) and normalizing these residuals,
the least-squares matrix solution for the spline coefficients IT(c)(IT(i)) is found by
solving the IT(n) by IT(n) linear system IT(w)(IT(j)) = sum-over-IT(i) {IT(c)(IT(i)) G(BD(x)(IT(j)); BD(x)(IT(i)))},
for IT(j) = 1, IT(n); this
solution yields an exact interpolation of the supplied data points.  Alternatively, you may
choose to perform a singular value decomposition (SVD) and eliminate the contribution from the
smallest eigenvalues; this approach yields an approximate solution.  Trends and scales are
restored when evaluating the output.

.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
None.
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
IT(table)
The name of one or more ASCII [or binary, see GMT_bi_OPT] files holding the BD(x), IT(w)
data points.  If no file is given then we read standard input instead.
.TP
OPT(A)[BD(1)|BD(2)|BD(3)|BD(4)|BD(5),]IT(gradfile)
The solution will partly be constrained by surface gradients BD(v) = IT(v)*BD(n), where IT(v) is the
gradient magnitude and BD(n) its unit vector direction.  The gradient direction may be specified either by
Cartesian components (either unit vector BD(n) and magnitude IT(v) separately or gradient components BD(v) directly)
or angles w.r.t. the coordinate axes.  Specify one of five input formats:
BD(0): For 1-D data there is no direction, just gradient magnitude (slope) so the input format is
IT(x), IT(gradient).  Options 1-2 are for 2-D data sets:
BD(1): records contain IT(x), IT(y), IT(azimuth), IT(gradient) (IT(azimuth) in degrees is measured
clockwise from the vertical (north) [Default]).
BD(2): records contain IT(x), IT(y), IT(gradient), IT(azimuth) (IT(azimuth) in degrees is measured
clockwise from the vertical (north)).  Options 3-5 are for either 2-D or 3-D data:
BD(3): records contain BD(x), IT(direction(s)), IT(v) (IT(direction(s)) in degrees are measured
counter-clockwise from the horizontal (and for 3-D the vertical axis). 
BD(4): records contain BD(x), BD(v).
BD(5): records contain BD(x), BD(n), IT(v).
Append name of ASCII file with the surface gradients (following a comma if a format is specified).  
.TP
OPT(C)IT(cut)[/IT(file)]
Find an approximate surface fit: Solve the linear system for the spline coefficients by SVD and eliminate the contribution
from all eigenvalues whose ratio to the largest
eigenvalue is less than IT(cut) [Default uses Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve the
linear system and fit the data exactly].  Optionally, append /IT(file) to
save the eigenvalue ratios to the specified file for further analysis.
Finally, if a negative IT(cut) is given then /IT(file) is required and execution
will stop after saving the eigenvalues, i.e., no surface output is produced.
.TP
OPT(D)IT(mode)
Sets the distance flag that determines how we calculate distances between data points.  
Select IT(mode) 0 for Cartesian 1-D spline interpolation:
OPT(D)0 means (IT(x)) in user units, Cartesian distances,
Select IT(mode) 1-3 for Cartesian 2-D surface spline interpolation:
OPT(D)1 means (IT(x),IT(y)) in user units, Cartesian distances,
OPT(D)2 for (IT(x),IT(y)) in degrees, Flat Earth distances, and
OPT(D)3 for (IT(x),IT(y)) in degrees, Spherical distances in km.
Then, if BD(PROJ_ELLIPSOID) is spherical, we compute great circle arcs, otherwise geodesics.
Option IT(mode) = 4 applies to spherical surface spline interpolation only:
OPT(D)4 for (IT(x),IT(y)) in degrees, use cosine of great circle (or geodesic) arcs.
Select IT(mode) 5 for Cartesian 3-D surface spline interpolation:
OPT(D)5 means (IT(x),IT(y),IT(z)) in user units, Cartesian distances.
.TP
OPT(G)IT(grdfile)
Name of resulting output file.  (1) If options OPT(R), OPT(I), and possibly OPT(r) are set we produce
an equidistant output table.  This will be written to stdout unless OPT(G) is specified.  Note: for 2-D
grids the OPT(G) option is required.  (2) If option OPT(T) is selected then OPT(G) is required and the
output file is a 2-D binary grid file.  Applies to 2-D interpolation only.
(3) If OPT(N) is selected then the output is an ASCII (or binary; see GMT_bo_OPT) table;
if OPT(G) is not given then this table is written to standard output.  Ignored if OPT(C) or OPT(C)0
is given.
.TP
OPT(I)IT(xinc)[IT(yinc)[IT(zinc)]]
Specify equidistant sampling intervals, on for each dimension, separated by slashes.
.TP
OPT(L)
Do IT(not) remove a linear (1-D) or planer (2-D) trend when OPT(D) selects mode 0-3 [For those Cartesian cases a least-squares
line or plane is modeled and removed, then restored after fitting a spline to the residuals].  However, in mixed
cases with both data values and gradients, or for spherical surface data, only the mean data value is removed
(and later and restored).
.TP
OPT(N)IT(nodefile)
ASCII file with coordinates of desired output locations BD(x) in the first column(s).  The resulting
IT(w) values are appended to each record and written to the file given in OPT(G) [or stdout if not specified];
see GMT_bo_OPT for binary output instead.  This option eliminates the need to
specify options OPT(R), OPT(I), and OPT(r).
.TP
OPT(Q)IT(az)|IT(x/y/z)
Rather than evaluate the surface, take the directional derivative in the IT(az) azimuth and return the magnitude of this
derivative instead.  For 3-D interpolation, specify the three components of the desired vector direction (the vector will
be normalized before use).
.TP
OPT(R)IT(xmin)/IT(xmax)[/IT(ymin)/IT(ymax)[/IT(zmin)IT(zmax)]]
Specify the domain for an equidistant lattice where output predictions are required.  Requires OPT(I) and optionally OPT(r).
.br
IT(1-D:)  Give IT(xmin/xmax), the minimum and maximum IT(x) coordinates.
.br
IT(2-D:)  Give IT(xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax), the minimum and maximum IT(x) and IT(y) coordinates.
These may be Cartesian or geographical.  If geographical, then
IT(west), IT(east), IT(south), and IT(north) specify the Region of interest, and you may specify them
in decimal degrees or in [+-]dd:mm[:ss.xxx][W|E|S|N] format.  The two shorthands OPT(Rg) and OPT(Rd) stand for global domain
(0/360 and -180/+180 in longitude respectively, with -90/+90 in latitude).
.br
IT(3-D:)  Give IT(xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax/zmin/zmax), the minimum and maximum IT(x), IT(y) and IT(z) coordinates.
See the 2-D section if your horizontal coordinates are geographical; note the shorthands OPT(Rg) and OPT(Rd) cannot
be used if a 3-D domain is specified.
.TP
OPT(S)BD(c|t|g|p|q)[IT(pars)]
Select one of five different splines.  The first two are used for 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D Cartesian splines (see OPT(D) for discussion).
Note that all tension values are expected to be normalized tension in the range 0 < IT(t) < 1:
(BD(c)) Minimum curvature spline [IT(Sandwell), 1987],
(BD(t)) Continuous curvature spline in tension [IT(Wessel and Bercovici), 1998]; append
IT(tension)[/IT(scale)] with IT(tension) in the 0\-1 range and optionally supply a length scale [Default is the average grid spacing].
The next is a 2-D or 3-D spline:
(BD(r)) Regularized spline in tension [IT(Mitasova and Mitas), 1993]; again, append IT(tension) and optional IT(scale).
The last two are spherical surface splines and both imply OPT(D)4 OPT(fg):
(BD(p)) Minimum curvature spline [IT(Parker), 1994],
(BD(q)) Continuous curvature spline in tension [IT(Wessel and Becker), 2008]; append IT(tension).
The G(\fBx'\fP; \fBx'\fP) for the last method is slower to compute; by specifying OPT(SQ) you can speed up calculations
by first pre-calculating G(\fBx'\fP; \fBx'\fP) for a dense set of BD(x) values (e.g., 100,001 nodes between -1 to +1)
and store them in look-up tables.  Optionally append /IT(N) (an odd integer) to specify how many points in the spline to set [100001]
.TP
OPT(T)IT(maskgrid)
For 2-D interpolation only.  Only evaluate the solution at the nodes in the IT(maskgrid) that are not equal to NaN. This option eliminates the need to
specify options OPT(R), OPT(I), and OPT(r).

.SH CONSIDERATIONS
(1) For the Cartesian cases we use the free-space Green functions, hence no boundary conditions are
applied at the edges of the specified domain.  For most applications this is fine as the region typically
is arbitrarily set to reflect the extent of your data.  However, if your application requires
particular boundary conditions then you may consider using BD(surface) instead.
.br
(2) In all cases, the solution is obtained by inverting a IT(n) x IT(n) double precision matrix for the Green
function coefficients, where IT(n)
is the number of data constraints.  Hence, your computer's memory may place restrictions on how large data\"'
sets you can process with BD(greenspline).  Pre-processing your data with BD(blockmean), BD(blockmedian),
or BD(blockmode) is recommended to avoid aliasing and may also control the size of IT(n). For information,
if IT(n) = 1024 then only 8 Mb memory is needed, but for IT(n) = 10240 we need 800 Mb. Note that
BD(greenspline) is fully 64-bit compliant if compiled as such.
.br
(3) The inversion for coefficients can become numerically unstable when data neighbors are very close
compared to the overall span of the data.  You can remedy this by pre-processing the data, e.g., by
averaging closely spaced neighbors.  Alternatively, you can improve stability by using the SVD solution and
discard information associated with the smallest eigenvalues (see OPT(C)).
.SH TENSION
Tension is generally used to suppress spurious oscillations caused by the minimum curvature requirement, in particular
when rapid gradient changes are present in the data.  The proper amount of tension can only be determined by experimentation.
Generally, very smooth data (such as potential fields) do not require much, if any tension, while rougher data (such
as topography) will typically interpolate better with moderate tension.  Make sure you try a range of values before
choosing your final result.  Note: the regularized spline in tension is only stable for a finite range of IT(scale) values;
you must experiment to find the valid range and a useful setting.  For more information on tension see the references below.
