.SH NAME
psimage \- To plot images (EPS files or Sun raster files) on maps
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpsimage\fP \fIimagefile\fP [ OPT(W)[\fB-\fP]\fIxlength\fP[/\fIylength\fP] | OPT(E)\fIdpi\fP ] [ OPT(C)\fIxpos\fP/\fIypos\fP[/\fIjustify\fP] ] 
[ OPT(F)\fIpen\fP ] [ OPT(G)[\fBf\fP|\fBb\fP]\fIcolor\fP ] [ OPT(I) ] [ GMT_K_OPT ] [ OPT(M) ] 
[ OPT(N)\fInxrep\fP[/\fInyrep\fP] ] [ GMT_O_OPT ] [ GMT_P_OPT ] [ GMT_U_OPT ] 
[ GMT_V_OPT ] [ GMT_X_OPT ] [ GMT_Y_OPT ] [ GMT_c_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpsimage\fP reads an Encapsulated \fIPostScript\fP\fR file or
a 1, 8, 24, or 32-bit Sun raster file and plots it on a map.
The image can be scaled arbitrarily, and 1-bit raster images can be (1) inverted, i.e.,
black pixels (on) becomes white (off) and vice versa, or (2) colorized, by
assigning different foreground and background colors, and (3) made transparent
where one of back- or foreground is painted only. As an option,
the user may choose to convert colored raster images to grayscale using TV's YIQ-transformation.\"'
The user may also choose to replicate the image which, when preceded by appropriate clip
paths, may allow larger custom-designed fill patterns to be implemented (the \fB\-Gp\fP
mechanism offered in most \fBGMT\fP programs is limited to rasters smaller than 146 by 146).
.TP
\fIimagefile\fP
This must be an Encapsulated \fIPostScript\fP\fR (EPS) file or a Sun raster file.
An EPS file must contain an appropriate BoundingBox.
A raster file can have a depth of 1, 8, 24, or 32 bits. Old-style, Standard, Run-length-encoded, and
RGB Sun raster files are supported.  Other raster formats can be converted
to Sun format via a variety of public-domain software (e.g., convert, xv).
.TP
.B \-E
Sets the dpi of the image in dots per inch, or use \fB\-W\fP.
.TP
.B \-W
Sets the size of the image in plot coordinates (inches, cm, etc.).
If not given \fIylength\fP is set to \fIxlength\fP * (ny/nx).
If \fIxlength\fP is negative we use the absolute value and interpolate image to the
device resolution using the \fIPostScript\fP image operator.
Alternatively, use \fB\-E\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
.B \-C
Sets position of the image in plot coordinates (inches, cm, etc.) from the current origin
of the plot.
By default, this defines the position of the lower left corner
of the image, but this can be changed by specifying justification [0/0/BL].
.TP
.B \-F
Draws a rectangular frame around the image with the given pen [no frame].
(See SPECIFYING PENS below).
.TP
.B \-Gb
Sets background color (replace white pixel) for 1-bit image templates.
Use - for transparency (and set \fB\-Gf\fP to the desired color).
(See SPECIFYING COLOR below).
.TP
.B \-Gf
Sets foreground color (replace black pixel) for 1-bit image templates.
Use - for transparency (and set \fB\-Gb\fP to the desired color).
(See SPECIFYING COLOR below).
.TP
.B \-I
Invert image before plotting (1-bit images only). This is what is done
when you use \fB\-GP\fP in other GMT programs.
#include "explain_-K.txt"
.TP
.B \-M
Convert color image to monochrome grayshades using the (television) YIQ-transformation.
.TP
.B \-N
Replicate the image \fInxrep\fP in x and \fInyrep\fP in y [Default is 1/1].

.SH EXAMPLES
To plot the image contained in the 8-bit raster file scanned_face.ras, scaling
it to 8 by 10 cm, use
.br
.sp
\fBpsimage\fP scanned_face.ras \fB\-W\fP8\fBc\fP/10\fBc\fP > image.ps
.br
.sp
To include an Encapsulated \fIPostScript\fP file tiger.eps with its upper right corner 2 inch to the right
and 1 inch up from the current location, and have its width scaled to 3 inches, use
.br
.sp
\fBpsimage\fP tiger.eps \fB\-C\fP2\fBi\fP/1\fBi\fP/TR \fB\-W\fP3\fBi\fP > image.ps
.br
.sp
To replicate the image template 1_bit.ras over a 5 by 5 inch area, colorize it (brown background and
red foreground), and setting each piece to be 1 by 1 cm, use
.br
.sp
\fBpsimage\fP 1_bit.ras \fB\-Gb\fPbrown \fB\-Gf\fPred \fB\-N\fP5\fBi\fP/5\fBi\fP \fB\-W\fP1\fBc\fP > image.ps
