\fBpsmask\fP OPT(C) [ GMT_K_OPT ] [ GMT_O_OPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpsmask\fP reads a (\fIx\fP,\fIy\fP,\fIz\fP) file [or standard input] and uses this information to find out
which grid cells are reliable.  Only gridcells which have one or more data points are considered
reliable.  As an option, you may specify a radius of influence. Then, all gridcells that are
within \fIradius\fP of a data point are considered reliable.  Furthermore, an option is provided to
reverse the sense of the test.  Having found the reliable/not reliable points, \fBpsmask\fP will
either paint tiles to mask these nodes (with the OPT(T) switch), or use contouring to create
polygons that will clip out regions of no interest.  When clipping is initiated, it will stay in
effect until turned off by a second call to \fBpsmask\fP using the OPT(C) option.
.TP
\fIxyzfile\fP
File with (\fIx\fP,\fIy\fP,\fIz\fP) values (e.g., that was used to run \fBsurface\fP).  If no file
is given, standard input is read.  For binary files, see OPT(b).

#include "explain_-R.txt"
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
#include "explain_-B_short.txt"
.TP
OPT(C)
Mark end of existing clip path.  No input file is needed.  Implicitly sets OPT(O).
However, you must supply OPT(Xa) and OPT(Ya) settings if you are using absolute positioning.
.TP
OPT(D)
Dumps out the resulting clipping polygons to disk.  Ignored if OPT(T) is set.
If no dumpprefix is given we use mask (Files will be called mask_*.d).
Append \fB\+n<n_pts>\fP to limit the number of points in files to a minimum of \fIn_pts\fP.
That is, do not write individual polygon files if they do not have at least \fIn_pts\fP vertices.
Often, when one uses the OPT(D) option it is not wished to output any ps code to stdout.
In such cases redirect the output to > /dev/null on *nix systems or to > nul on Windows.
#include "explain_-E.txt"
#include "explain_nodereg.txt"
.TP
OPT(G)
Paint the clip polygons (or tiles) with a selected fill [Default is no fill].
(See SPECIFYING FILL below).
#include "explain_-H.txt"
Not used with binary data.
#include "explain_-K.txt"
#include "explain_-M.txt"
.TP
OPT(N)
Invert the sense of the test, i.e. clip regions where there is data coverage.
#include "explain_-O.txt"
#include "explain_-P.txt"
.TP
OPT(S)
Sets radius of influence. Grid nodes within \fIradius\fP of a data point are considered reliable. [Default is 0, which
means that only grid cells with data in them are reliable].  Append \fBm\fP to indicate minutes
or \fBc\fP to indicate seconds.  Append \fBk\fP to indicate km (implies OPT(R) and OPT(I) are in degrees, and
we will use a fast flat Earth approximation to calculate distance).  For more accuracy, use uppercase \fBK\fP
if distances should be calculated along geodesics.
However, if the current \fBELLIPSOID\fP is set to Sphere then spherical great circle calculations are used.
.TP
OPT(T)
Plot tiles instead of clip polygons.  Use OPT(G) to set tile color or pattern.

.SH EXAMPLES
To make an overlay \fIPostScript\fP file that will mask out the regions of a contour map
where there is no control data using clip polygons, use:

.sp
\fBpsmask\fP africa_grav.xyg OPT(R)20/40/20/40 OPT(I)5\fBm\fP OPT(JM)10\fBi\fP OPT(O) OPT(K) > mask.ps
.br
.sp
The same example but this time we use white tiling:

\fBpsmask\fP africa_grav.xyg OPT(R)20/40/20/40 OPT(I)5\fBm\fP OPT(JM)10\fBi\fP OPT(T) OPT(O) OPT(K) OPT(G)white > mask.ps
