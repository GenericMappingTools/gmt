	dimfilter - Filtering of 2-D gridded data and
	   assisting in calculation of MAD error envelope

dimfilter derives from grdfilter but allows for directional filtering
of grids (*).  The dim.template.sh is a skeleton shell script that can
be used to set up a complete DiM analysis, including the MAD analysis.
