OPT(X) OPT(Y)
Shift plot origin relative to the current origin by (\fIx-shift,y-shift\fP) and
optionally append the length unit (\fBc\fP, \fBi\fP, \fBm\fP, \fBp\fP).
You can prepend \fBa\fP to shift the origin back to the original position after plotting,
or prepend  \fBr\fP [Default] to reset the current origin to the new location.
If OPT(O) is used then the default (\fIx-shift,y-shift\fP) is (0,0), otherwise it is
(r1i, r1i) or (r2.5c, r2.5c).
Alternatively, give \fBc\fP to align the center coordinate (x or y) of the plot with the center of the page
based on current page size.
