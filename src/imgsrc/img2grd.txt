.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBimg2grd\fP is a front-end to \fBimg2mercgrd\fP which reads an img format file and creates a grdfile.
The \fB\-M\fP option dictates whether or not the Spherical Mercator 
projection of the img file is preserved.
.TP
\fIimgfile\fP
An img format file such as the marine gravity or seafloor topography fields estimated from 
satellite altimeter data by Sandwell and Smith.  If the user has set an environment variable 
GMT_IMGDIR, then \fBimg2mercgrd\fP will try to find \fIimgfile\fP in $GMT_IMGDIR; else it 
will try to open \fIimgfile\fP directly.
.TP
.B \-G
\fIgrdfile\fP is the name of the output grdfile.
.TP
.B \-R
\fIwest, east, south,\fP and \fInorth\fP specify the Region of interest.  To specify boundaries
in degrees and minutes, use the dd:mm format.
.TP
.B \-T
\fItype\fP handles the encoding of constraint information.  \fItype\fP = 0 indicates that no 
such information is encoded in the img file (used for pre-1995 versions of the gravity data) 
and gets all data.  \fItype\fP > 0 indicates that constraint information is encoded (1995 and 
later (current) versions of the img files) so that one may produce a grd file as follows: 
\fB\-T\fP\fI1\fP gets data values at all points, \fB\-T\fP\fI2\fP gets data values at 
constrained points and NaN at interpolated points; \fB\-T\fP\fI3\fP gets 1 at constrained 
points and 0 at interpolated points. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-E
Can be used when \fB\-M\fP is not set to force the final grid to have the exact same region
as requested with \fB\-R\fP.  By default, the final region is a direct projection of the
original Mercator region and will typically extend slightly beyond the requested latitude
range, and futhermore the grid increment in latitude does not match the longitude increment.
However, the extra resampling introduces small interpolation errors and should only
be used if the output grid must match the requested region and have x_inc = y_inc.
.TP
.B \-L
With no other arguments, list all *.img files found in the directory pointed to by
$GMT_IMGDIR, or the current directory if not defined.  Ignored if other options are
present on the command line.
.TP
.B \-M
Output a Spherical Mercator grid [Default is a geographic lon/lat grid].
.TP
.B \-N
Average the values in the input img pixels into \fInavg\fP by \fInavg\fP squares, and 
create one output pixel for each such square.  If used with \fB\-T\fP\fI3\fP it will 
report an average constraint between 0 and 1.  If used with \fB\-T\fP\fI2\fP the output 
will be average data value or NaN according to whether average constraint is > 0.5.  
\fInavg\fP must evenly divide into the dimensions of the imgfile in pixels.  
[Default \fI1\fP does no averaging].
.TP
.B \-S
Multiply the img file values by \fIscale\fP before storing in grd file.  [Default is 1.0].  
(img topo files are stored in (corrected) meters; gravity files in mGal*10; vertical 
deflection files in microradians*10, vertical gravity gradient files in Eotvos*10.)
.TP
.B \-V
Selects verbose mode, which will send progress reports to stderr [Default runs "silently"].  
Particularly recommended here, as it is helpful to see how the coordinates are adjusted.
.TP
.B \-m
Indicate \fIminutes\fP as the width of an input img pixel in minutes of longitude.  
[Default is 2.0].
.TP
.B \-x
Indicate \fImaxlon\fP as the maximum longitude extent of the input img file.  Versions 
since 1995 have had \fImaxlon\fP = 360.0, while some earlier files had \fImaxlon\fP = 
390.0.  [Default is 360.0].
.TP
.B \-y
Indicate \fIminlat/maxlat\fP as the latitude extent of the input img file.  All versions 
to date have used -72.006/72.006.  [Default is -72.006/72.006].
.SH EXAMPLES
To extract data in the region \fB\-R\fP-40/40/-70/-30 from \fIworld_grav.img.7.2\fP and preserve
the Mercator gridding:
.br
.sp
\fBimg2grd\fP world_grav.img.7.2 \fB\-G\fPmerc_grav.grd \fB\-R\fP-40/40/-70/-30 \fB\-M \-T\fP1 \fB\-V\fP
.br
.sp
Without the \fB\-M\fP option the same command will yield a geographic grid.
