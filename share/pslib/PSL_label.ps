%-	PS routines for handling contour labels and clipping of
%-	contour lines going through labels.
%-
%-	There are two parts.  First is something straight out of
%-	the Adobe Cookbook for placing text along a curved line.
%-	The second part is the functions that assist in finding
%-	out where labels are placed and setting clip paths etc.
%-
%-	Make sure that the version number matches the one mentioned in pslib.c

/PSL_pathtextdict 26 dict def			% Local storage for the procedure PSL_pathtext.

/PSL_pathtext					% PSL_pathtext'' will place a string
  {PSL_pathtextdict begin			% of text along any path. It takes
    /textheight exch def			% a string and starting offset
    /just exch def				% distance from the beginning of
    /offset exch def				% the path as its arguments. Note
    /str exch def				% that PSL_pathtext assumes that a
						% path has already been defined
						% and after it places the text
						% along the path, it clears the
						% current path like the ``stroke''
						% and ``fill'' operators; it also
						% assumes that a font has been
						% set. ``pathtext'' begins placing
						% the characters along the current
						% path, starting at the offset
						% distance and continuing until
						% either the path length is
						% exhausted or the entire string
						% has been printed, whichever
						% occurs first. The results will
						% be more effective when a small
						% point size font is used with
						% sharp curves in the path.

	{curvetoproc} {closepathproc}		% the segments of the path,

						% far (pathdist). We also keep
						% track of the distance taken up
						% by the characters that have been
						% set so far (setdist). When the
						% distance we have travelled along
						% the path is greater than the
						% distance taken up by the set
						% characters, we are ready to set
						% the next character (if there are
						% any left to be set). This

% PSL LABEL CLIP FUNCTIONS

% Two main functions deals with label placement and clipping:
% PSL_curved_path_labels: 	handles texts that must follow curved baselines
% PSL_straight_path_labels:	handles texts that have straight baselines
%
% Both functions assume that several variables have been predefined:
%
% First we have these two constant settings for all text boxes:
%
%   PSL_setboxpen  Function that sets the text box pen attributes (width, texture, color)
%   PSL_setboxrgb  Function that sets the opaque text box color
%
% Then several arrays are placed.  Since a set of several lines segments may each
% have many labels along them, we end up with these variables:
%
%   PSL_n_paths		Total number of segments
%   PSL_path_x		x coordinates of the paths (all concatenated one after another)
%   PSL_path_y		y coordinates of the paths (all concatenated one after another)
%   PSL_path_n		Array with number of points per segment
%   PSL_label_str  	Array with all the labels for all segments
%   PSL_label_n		Array with number of labels per segment
%   PSL_angle		The annotation angle for each label
%
% PSL_curved_path_labels expects those labels to be placed along several
% lines and it needs the node numbers where to place text:
%
% PSL_node	Array with (x,y) node number of label position
%
% PSL_straight_path_labels are simpler and instead expects
%
% PSL_txt_x	(x,y) coordinates of the location of the m labels
% PSL_txt_y
