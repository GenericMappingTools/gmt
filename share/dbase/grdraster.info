#
# This file contains information on rasterfiles which are readable with grdraster.
# This file must be named grdraster.info.  At run time, grdraster will look for
# this file in $GMT_USERDIR (which defaults to ~/.gmt), $GMT_GRIDDIR, and
# $GMT_SHAREDIR/dbase (in that order).  Any line beginning with a # will be
# treated as a comment, and blank lines are skipped.  Any other line must have
# the following items, all on one line, one line, pertaining to one rasterfile:
#
# file_number "title string" "z units" -R -I GorP type scale offset NaNflag filename [L|B] [H<bytes>]
#
# There must be white space between each item.  "title string" and "z units" must
# be enclosed in " ", and they may have white space within them.  They are limited
# to a maximum of 80 characters.  No other quotation marks should be on a line.
# The entire line should be writable in 320 characters.
#
# file_number is an integer used to tell grdraster which raster to read.  It must
# 	be unique to each raster.
# "title string" is a brief description of the data.
# "z units"  describes the units of the data after they are scaled and offset.
# -R<w>/<e>/<s>/<n> describes the range of the raster in the usual GMT -R manner.
# -I<x_inc>/<y_inc> describes the sampling interval in the usual GMT -I manner.
# GorP is either G or P, indicating Grid or Pixel registration.  Optionally, you
#	can append G (Geographic) or C (Cartesian) to explicitly set this attribute
#	which would otherwise be guessed based on the x/y range
# type is one of the following, indicating the kind of data stored in the raster:
#	b	bit data, either 0 or 1, one bit per data value.
#	u	unsigned character data.
#	c	signed character data.
#	d	unsigned two-byte integer data.
#	i	signed two-byte integer data.
#	l	signed four-byte integer data.
# scale is a number which should be multiplied on the raster value after read.
# offset is a number which should be added to the [scaled] raster value.
# NaNflag is a number which is written in the raster to represent NaN.
#	If all values in the raster represent data, NaNflag is none.
# filename is the name the raster file.  If filename begins with a "/", then
#	it will be treated as a complete name.  If not, we will look for the
#	file in the directories pointed to by $GMT_DATADIR.
#
# BYTE-ORDER:
#
# Optionally, you may append a single character L (for Little-endian) or B (for
# Big-endian) to indicate the endian-ness of this data file.  If the present
# endianness of your computer has a different endianness that specified for the
# chosen data set, then grdraster will automatically swap the bytes.  The
# endianness of your computer is automatically determined at compile-time.
#
# You will need to edit this to reflect which data you have installed on your
# system, and optionally append L or B to indicate endian-ness:
#
# Finally, if your raster grid has a header you can specify the size of the header
# in bytes and grdraster will skip these bytes before reading the data
