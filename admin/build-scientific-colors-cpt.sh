# and converts the *.cpt files into proper GMT master
# CPT files with correct attribution and hinge info
# Run from the ScientificColourMapsV directory (V is version) after the
# zip has downloaded and been expanded.  But first you need to manually
# update the /tmp/cpt.info entries below with one line per CPT subdir in the
# downloaded directory.  It will create a gmt subdirectory with all the CPTs.
# You also need to edit gmt_cpt_masters.h after adding the CPTs to share/cpt
#
# Last setup and run for ScientificColourMaps7 on 21/02/2021 for GMT 6.2 (master)
# Gave 51 CPTS: The original 30 plus 5 cyclical versions and 16 categorical versions

	Usage: build-scientific-colors-cpt.sh <SCM-directory>

	Will create the GMT CPT versions of Crameri's scientific colour maps.
	Give the full path to the expanded zip file top directory, such as
	~/Download/ScientificColourMaps7.
	Before running you must update this script with:
	  1. Any new CPT entries since the last release to /tmp/cpt.info
	  2. Flag those with a soft hinge as S and a hard hinge as H
	  3. Manually set the current version number/doi (see the zip PDF docs)
	Afterwards you must:
	  1. Update src/gmt_cpt_masters.h with any new entries (copy lines from /tmp/cpt_strings.txt)
	  2. Adding the CPTs to share/cpt (overwriting the previous versions)
	  3. Probably mess with doc/scripts/GMT_App_M*.sh for new layouts
