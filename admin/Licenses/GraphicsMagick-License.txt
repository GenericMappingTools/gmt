GraphicsMagick makes use of third-party "delegate" libraries to support certain optional features. These libraries bear their own copyrights and licenses, which may be more or less restrictive than the GraphicsMagick license. For convenience, when GraphicsMagick is bundled with (or compiled with) "delegate" libraries, a copy of the licenses for these libraries is provided in a "licenses" directory.
