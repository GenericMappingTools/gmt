# This script takes the downloaded zip content from
# Crameri, F., (2018). Scientific colour-maps. Zenodo
# http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1243862
# and converts the *.cpt files into proper GMT master
# CPT files with correct attribution and hinge info
# Run from the ScientificColourMapsX directory (X is version) after the
# zip has downloaded and been expanded.  But first you need to manually
# update the /tmp/cpt.info entries below with one line per CPT subdir in the
# downloaded directory.  It will create a gmt subdirectory with all the CPTs.
# You also need to edit gmt_cpt_masters.h after adding the CPTs to share/cpt
#
# Last setup and run for ScientificColourMaps6 on 7/11/2020 for GMT 6.1
# Gave 28 CPTS: The original 24 plus 4 cyclical versions

	Usage: build_scientific_colors_cpt.sh
	
	build_scientific_colors_cpt.sh must be run from top-level gmt directory.
	Will create the GMT CPT version of Crameri's scientific colour maps.
	Give the full path to the expanded zip file top directory, such as
	~/Download/ScientificColourMaps6
	Before running you must update this script with:
	  1. Any new CPT entries since his last release to cpt.info
	  2. Flag those with soft hinge as S and hard hinge as H
	  3. Manually set the current version number (see the PDF docs)
	Afterwards you must:
	  1. Update gmt_cpt_masters.h with any new entries
	  2. Adding the CPTs to share (overwriting the previous versions)
