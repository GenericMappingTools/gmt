Description
-----------

**psxy** reads (*x*,\ *y*) pairs from *files* [or standard input] and
will plot lines, polygons, or symbols
at those locations on a map. If a symbol is selected and no symbol size
given, then **psxy** will interpret the third column of the input data
as symbol size. Symbols whose *size* is <= 0 are skipped. If no symbols
are specified then the symbol code (see **-S** below) must be present as
last column in the input. If **-S** is not used, a line connecting the
data points will be drawn instead. To explicitly close polygons, use
**-L**. Select a fill with **-G**. If **-G** is set, **-W** will control
whether the polygon outline is drawn or not. If a symbol is selected,
**-G** and **-W** determines the fill and outline/no outline,
respectively.

Required Arguments
------------------

.. _-J:

.. |Add_-J| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: explain_-J.rst_

.. _-R:

.. |Add_-R| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: explain_-R.rst_

.. |Add_-Rz| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: explain_-Rz.rst_

Optional Arguments
------------------

.. |Add_intables| replace:: Use **-T** to ignore all input files, including standard input (see below).
.. include:: explain_intables.rst_

.. _-A:

**-A**\ [**m**\ \|\ **p**\ \|\ **x**\ \|\ **y**]
    By default, geographic line segments are drawn as great circle arcs. To draw them as
    straight lines, use the **-A** flag.  Alternatively, add **m** to draw
    the line by first following a meridian, then a parallel. Or append **p**
    to start following a parallel, then a meridian. (This can be practical
    to draw a line along parallels, for example).  For Cartesian data, points
    are simply connected, unless you append **x** or **y** to draw stair-case
    curves that whose first move is along *x* or *y*, respectively.

.. _-B:

.. include:: explain_-B.rst_

.. _-C:

**-C**\ *cpt*
    Give a CPT or specify **-C**\ *color1,color2*\ [*,color3*\ ,...]
    to build a linear continuous CPT from those colors automatically.
    In this case *color*\ **n** can be a r/g/b triplet, a color name,
    or an HTML hexadecimal color (e.g. #aabbcc ).
    If **-S** is set, let symbol fill color be
    determined by the z-value in the third column. Additional fields are
    shifted over by one column (optional size would be 4th rather than 3rd
    field, etc.). If **-S** is not set, then **psxy** expects the user to
    supply a multisegment file where each segment header contains a
    **-Z**\ *val* string. The *val* will control the color of the line or
    polygon (if **-L** is set) via the CPT.

.. _-D:

**-D**\ *dx*/*dy*
    Offset the plot symbol or line locations by the given amounts *dx/dy*
    [Default is no offset]. If *dy* is not given it is set equal to *dx*.

.. _-E:

**-E**\ [**x**\ \|\ **y**\ \|\ **X**\ \|\ **Y**][**+a**][**+cl**\ \|\ **f**\ ][**+n**][**+w**\ *cap*][**+p**\ *pen*]
    Draw symmetrical error bars. Append **x** and/or **y** to indicate which bars you
    want to draw (Default is both x and y). The x and/or y errors must be
    stored in the columns after the (x,y) pair [or (x,y,z) triplet]. If
    **+a** is appended then we will draw asymmetrical error bars; these requires
    two rather than one extra data column, with the low and high value.
    If upper case **X** and/or **Y** are used we will instead draw
    "box-and-whisker" (or "stem-and-leaf") symbols. The x (or y) coordinate
    is then taken as the median value, and four more columns are expected to
    contain the minimum (0% quantile), the 25% quantile, the 75% quantile,
    and the maximum (100% quantile) values. The 25-75% box may be filled by
    using **-G**. If **+n** is appended the we draw a notched
    "box-and-whisker" symbol where the notch width reflects the uncertainty
    in the median. This symbol requires a 5th extra data column to contain the
    number of points in the distribution.  The **+w** modifier sets the
    *cap* width that indicates the length of the end-cap on the error bars
    [7\ **p**]. Pen attributes for error bars may also be set via **+p**\ *pen*.
    [Defaults: width = default, color = black, style = solid]. When **-C** is
    used we can control how the look-up color is applied to our symbol.
    Append **+cf** to use it to fill the symbol, while **+cl** will just
    set the error pen color and turn off symbol fill.  Giving **+c** will
    set both color items.

.. _-F:

**-F**\ [**c**\ \|\ **n**\ \|\ **r**\ ][**a**\ \|\ **f**\ \|\ **s**\ \|\ **r**\ \|\ *refpoint*]
    Alter the way points are connected (by specifying a *scheme*) and data are grouped (by specifying a *method*).
    Append one of three line connection schemes:
    **c**\ : Draw continuous line segments for each group [Default].
    **r**\ : Draw line segments from a reference point reset for each group.
    **n**\ : Draw networks of line segments between all points in each group.
    Optionally, append the one of four segmentation methods to define the group:
    **a**\ : Ignore all segment headers, i.e., let all points belong to a single group,
    and set group reference point to the very first point of the first file.
    **f**\ : Consider all data in each file to be a single separate group and
    reset the group reference point to the first point of each group.
    **s**\ : Segment headers are honored so each segment is a group; the group
    reference point is reset to the first point of each incoming segment [Default].
    **r**\ : Same as **s**, but the group reference point is reset after
    each record to the previous point (this method is only available with the **-Fr** scheme).
    Instead of the codes **a**\ \|\ **f**\ \|\ **s**\ \|\ **r** you may append
    the coordinates of a *refpoint* which will serve as a fixed external
    reference point for all groups.

.. _-G:

**-G**\ *fill* :ref:`(more ...) <-Gfill_attrib>`
    Select color or pattern for filling of symbols or polygons [Default is no fill].
    Note that **psxy** will search for **-G** and **-W** strings in all the
    segment headers and let any values thus found over-ride the command line settings.

.. _-I:

**-I**\ *intens*
    Use the supplied *intens* value (nominally in the -1 to + 1 range) to
    modulate the fill color by simulating illumination [none].

.. _-K:

.. include:: explain_-K.rst_

.. _-L:

**-L**\ [**+b**\ \|\ **d**\ \|\ **D**][**+xl**\ \|\ **r**\ \|\ *x0*][**+yl**\ \|\ **r**\ \|\ *y0*][**+p**\ *pen*] |ex_OPT-L|
    Force closed polygons.  Alternatively, append modifiers to build a polygon from a line segment.
    Append **+d** to build symmetrical envelope around y(x) using deviations dy(x) given in extra column 3.
    Append **+D** to build asymmetrical envelope around y(x) using deviations dy1(x) and dy2(x) from extra columns 3-4.
    Append **+b** to build asymmetrical envelope around y(x) using bounds yl(x) and yh(x) from extra columns 3-4.
    Append **+xl**\ \|\ **r**\ \|\ *x0* to connect first and last point to anchor points at either xmin, xmax, or x0, or
    append **+yb**\ \|\ **t**\ \|\ *y0* to connect first and last point to anchor points at either ymin, ymax, or y0.
    Polygon may be painted (**-G**) and optionally outlined by adding **+p**\ *pen* [no outline].

.. _-N:

**-N**\ [**c**\ \|\ **r**]
    Do NOT clip symbols that fall outside map border [Default plots points
    whose coordinates are strictly inside the map border only]. The option does not apply to lines and polygons
    which are always clipped to the map region. For periodic (360-longitude)
    maps we must plot all symbols twice in case they are clipped by the repeating
    boundary. The **-N** will turn off clipping and not plot repeating symbols.
    Use **-Nr** to turn off clipping but retain the plotting of such repeating symbols, or
    use **-Nc** to retain clipping but turn off plotting of repeating symbols.

.. _-O:

.. include:: explain_-O.rst_

.. _-P:

.. include:: explain_-P.rst_

.. _-S:

.. include:: explain_symbols.rst_

.. _-T:

**-T**
    Ignore all input files, including standard input. This is the same
    as specifying /dev/null (or NUL for Windows users) as input file.
    Use this to activate only the options that are not related to
    plotting of lines or symbols, such as **psxy** **-R** **-J** **-O**
    **-T** to terminate a sequence of GMT plotting commands without
    producing any plotting output.

.. _-U:

.. include:: explain_-U.rst_

.. _-V:

.. |Add_-V| unicode:: 0x20 .. just an invisible code
.. include:: explain_-V.rst_

.. _-W:

**-W**\ [*pen*][*attr*] :ref:`(more ...) <-Wpen_attrib>`
    Set pen attributes for lines or the outline of symbols [Defaults:
    width = default, color = black, style = solid]. If the modifier **+cl**
    is appended then the color of the line are taken from the CPT (see
    **-C**). If instead modifier **+cf** is appended then the color from the cpt
    file is applied to symbol fill.  Use just **+c** for both effects.
    You can also append one or more additional line attribute modifiers:
    **+o**\ *offset*\ **u** will start and stop drawing the line the given distance offsets
    from the end point.  Append unit **u** from **c**\ \|\ **i**\ \|\ **p** to
    indicate plot distance on the map or append map distance units instead (see below)
    [Cartesian distances];
    **+s** will draw the line using a Bezier spline [linear spline];
    **+v**\ *vspecs* will place a vector head at the ends of the lines.  You can
    use **+vb** and **+ve** to specify separate vector specs at each end [shared specs].
    Because **+v** may take additional modifiers it must necessarily be given
    at the end of the pen specification.
    See the :ref:`Vec_attributes` for more information.

.. |Add_-bi| replace:: [Default is the required number of columns given the chosen settings].

Examples
--------

To plot solid red circles (diameter = 0.2 cm) at the positions listed
in the file DSDP.txt on a Mercator map at 0.3 cm/degree of the area 100E to
160E, 20S to 30N, with automatic tick-marks and gridlines, use

   ::

    gmt psxy DSDP.txt -R100/160/-20/30 -Jm0.3c -Sc0.2c -Gred -Bafg > map.ps

To plot the xyz values in the file quakes.xyzm as circles with size
given by the magnitude in the 4th column and color based on the depth in
the third using the CPT rgb.cpt on a linear map, use

   ::

    gmt psxy quakes.xyzm -R0/1000/0/1000 -JX6i -Sc -Crgb -B200 > map.ps

To plot the file trench.txt on a Mercator map, with white triangles with
sides 0.25 inch on the left side of the line, spaced every 0.8 inch, use

   ::

    gmt psxy trench.txt -R150/200/20/50 -Jm0.15i -Sf0.8i/0.1i+l+t -Gwhite -W -B10 > map.ps

To plot the data in the file misc.txt as symbols determined by the code in
the last column, and with size given by the magnitude in the 4th column,
and color based on the third column via the CPT chrome on a
linear map, use

   ::

    gmt psxy misc.txt -R0/100/-50/100 -JX6i -S -Cchrome -B20 > map.ps

If you need to place vectors on a plot you can choose among
straight Cartesian vectors, math circular vectors, or geo-vectors (these
form small or great circles on the Earth).  These can have optional heads at either
end, and heads may be the traditional arrow, a circle, or a terminal cross-line.
To place a few vectors with
a circle at the start location and an arrow head at the end, try

   ::

    gmt psxy -R0/50/-50/50 -JX6i -Sv0.15i+bc+ea -Gyellow -W0.5p -Baf << EOF > map.ps
    10 10 45 2i
    30 -20 0 1.5i
    EOF

To plot vectors (red vector heads, solid stem) from the file data.txt that contains
record of the form lon, lat, dx, dy, where dx, dy are the Cartesian
vector components given in user units, and these user units should be converted
to cm given the scale 3.60, try

   ::

    gmt psxy -R20/40/-20/0 -JM6i -Sv0.15i+e+z3.6c -Gred -W0.25p -Baf data.txt > map.ps

Segment Header Parsing
----------------------

Segment header records may contain one of more of the following options:

**-G**\ *fill*
    Use the new *fill* and turn filling on
**-G-**
    Turn filling off
**-G**
    Revert to default fill (none if not set on command line)
**-W**\ *pen*
    Use the new *pen* and turn outline on
**-W**
    Revert to default pen :ref:`MAP_DEFAULT_PEN <MAP_DEFAULT_PEN>`
    (if not set on command line)
**-W-**
    Turn outline off
**-Z**\ *zval*
    Obtain fill via cpt lookup using z-value *zval*
**-Z**\ *NaN*
    Get the NaN color from the CPT

Custom Symbols
--------------

**psxy** allows users to define and plot their own custom symbols. This
is done by encoding the symbol using our custom symbol macro code
described in Appendix N. Put all the macro codes for your new symbol in
a file whose extension must be .def; you may then address the symbol
without giving the extension (e.g., the symbol file tsunami.def is used
by specifying **-Sk**\ *tsunami/size*. The definition file can contain
any number of plot code records, as well as blank lines and comment
lines (starting with #). **psxy** will look for the definition files in
(1) the current directory, (2) the ~/.gmt directory, and
(3) the **$GMT_SHAREDIR**/custom directory, in that order.
Freeform polygons (made up of straight line segments and arcs of
circles) can be designed - these polygons can be painted and filled with
a pattern. Other standard geometric symbols can also be used. See Appendix
:ref:`App-custom_symbols` for macro definitions.

GMT4 Vector
-----------

Note: The old-style, single-polygon vector available in GMT4 and earlier versions
has been added to GMT5 for backwards compatibility with old scripts.
For reference, the old vector syntax is listed here:
The *size*, if present, will be interpreted as *arrowwidth/headlength/headwidth*.
By default, arrow attributes remain invariant to the length
of the arrow.  To have the size of the vector scale down with decreasing length,
append **n**\ *norm*, so that vectors shorter than *norm* will have their
dimensions scaled by the vector length divided by *norm*.
To center the vector on the balance (mid) point, use **-Svb**; to align point with the vector head,
use **-Svh**; to align point with the vector tail, use **-Svt** [Default].
If the input has the head point's coordinates instead of direction and length, use **-Svs**.
Upper case **B**, **H**, **T**, or **S** will draw a double-headed vector [Default is single head].

Polar Caps
----------

**psxy** will automatically determine if a closed polygon is containing
a geographic pole, i.e., being a polar cap.  Such polygons requires special
treatment under the hood to ensure proper filling.  Many tools such
as GIS packages are unable to handle polygons covering a pole and some
cannot handle polygons crossing the Dateline.  They work around this
problem by splitting polygons into a west and east polygon or inserting
artificial helper lines that makes a cut into the pole and back.  Such
doctored polygons may be misrepresented in GMT.
