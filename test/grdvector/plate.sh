# Plot r,az vectors on the globe.  The issue here is that some tools
# such as psvelo, scales the user lengths to inches and thus vectors
# of the same user length become the same scaled lengthon the plot.
# With geo-vectors we instead scale user lengths to km and then these
# are projected and can appear longer or shorter depending on projection.
# We need a mode to turn off geo-vectors when we want the psvelo effect.
# Update: This has now been implemented and test passes
