# This is README for the test directory
# Each program or theme should have a separate directory
# which may contain any number of Bourne (*.sh)
# scripts that tests one or more aspects of the program.
# The script should report a PASS/FAIL grade so
# that it is easy to tell which test failed.
# Originals of PS files or log files should be placed in a subdirectory
# named "orig".
# In addition, each script that fails should add a single line
# to the file ../fail_count.d so we may report a total.
