# This is README for the test directory
#
# Each program or theme should have a separate directory
# which may contain any number of Bash (*.sh)
# scripts that tests one or more aspects of the program.
# The script should report a PASS/FAIL grade so
# that it is easy to tell which test failed.
# Scripts making plots should also have an original PS file
# with the same file prefix as the script (stuff.sh -> stuff.ps).
# In addition, each script that fails should add a single line
# to the file ../fail_count.txt so we may report a total.
# Scripts that are known to fail can be excluded from the test
# by adding the comment
#	# GMT_KNOWN_FAILURE
# to the script anywhere.  Their failures will be listed in the
# test/fail_count.txt file but not counted by ctest.
#
# Under Linux you can have all module calls be run via valgrind
# in order to track down pesky memory leaks.  To do this, cd
# into the build directory and do this:
# 1. Remove old logs with: find . -name '.log' -exec rm -f {} \;
# 2. export VALGRIND_ARGS="--track-origins=yes --leak-check=full"
# Afterwards you can find all the *.log files and examine them.
# On any OS you can activate the full GMT memory tracking by
# setting
# 	export GMT_TRACK_MEMORY=2
# This assumes you configured GMT via with cmake/ConfigUserAdvanced.cmake
#	add_definitions(-DDEBUG)
#	add_definitions(-DMEMDEBUG)
