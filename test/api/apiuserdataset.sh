# Test the C API for conversions between user matrices and

# gmtmath which multiplies by 10 and adds 1, then writes
# out the dataset to another user matrix.  We try all possible
# combinations of matrix types (char, intc, etc) and do
# the case of user pre-allocated output matrix or letting
# GMT allocate it.
