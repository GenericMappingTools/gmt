Predefined Bit and Hachure Patterns in GMT
==========================================

GMT provides 90 different bit and hachure patterns that can be
selected with the **-Gp** or **-GP** option in most plotting programs.
The left side of each image was created using **-Gp**, the right side
shows the inverted version using **-GP**. These patterns are reproduced
below at 300 dpi using the default black and white shades.
