# The Founders

GMT was conceived and designed in the late 1980s and early 1990s
by [Paul Wessel](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/) and
[Walter H.F. Smith](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/star/Smith_WHF.php).
The two founders built and maintained GMT from version 1 through 3.

GMT 4 benefitted from numerous contributions from two new team members
[Remko Scharroo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Remko_Scharroo)
and [Joaquim Luis](http://w3.ualg.pt/~jluis/).

GMT 5 saw major new contributions from team member Florian Wobbe.

GMT 6 has benefitted from the contributions of two new team members
