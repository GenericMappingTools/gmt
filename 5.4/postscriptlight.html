<p>PSL 5.1 - A PostScript based plotting library</p>
<div class="section" id="description">
<h2>Description<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PSL (PostScriptLight) was created to make the generation of PostScript page
description code easier. PS is a page description language developed by
the Adobe for specifying how a printer should render a page of text or
graphics. It uses a reverse Polish notation that puts and gets items
from a stack to draws lines, text, and images and even performs
calculations. PSL is a self-contained library that presents a series
of functions that can be used to create plots. The resulting
PostScript code is ASCII text (with some exceptions for images if so
desired) and can thus be edited using any text editor. Thus, it is
possible to modify a plot file even after it has been created, e.g., to
change text strings, set new gray shades or colors, experiment with
various pen widths, etc. Furthermore, various tools exist that can parse
PostScript and let you make such edits via a graphical user interface
(e.g., Adobe Illustrator). PSL is written in C but includes FORTRAN
bindings and can therefore be called from both C and FORTRAN programs.
To use this library, you must link your plotting program with PSL.
PSL is used by the GMT graphics programs to generate PS. PSL
output is freeform PostScript that conforms to the Adobe PostScript
File Specification Version 3.0.</p>
<p>Before any PSL calls can be issued, the plotting system must be
initialized. This is done by calling <strong>PSL_beginsession</strong>, which
initializes a new PSL session; then call <strong>PSL_setdefaults</strong> which
sets internal variables and default settings, accepts settings for
measurement units and character encoding, and returns a pointer to a
struct PSL_CTRL which must be passed as first argument to all other
PSL functions. The measure unit for sizes and positions can be set
to be centimeter (c), inch (i), meter (m), or points
(p). A PSL session is terminated by calling
<strong>PSL_endsession</strong>. You may create one or more plots within the same
session. A new plot is started by calling <strong>PSL_beginplot</strong>, which
defines macros, sets up the plot-coordinate system, scales, and
[optionally] opens a file where all the PS code will be written.
Normally, the plot code is written to <em>stdout</em>. When all plotting to
this file is done, you finalize the plot by calling <strong>PSL_endplot</strong>.</p>
<p>A wide variety of output devices that support PostScript exist,
including many printers and large-format plotters. Many tools exists to
display PostScript on a computer screen. Open source tools such as
ghostscript can be used to convert PostScript into PDF or raster
images (e.g., TIFF, JPEG) at a user-defined resolution (DPI). In
particular, the GMT tool <a class="reference internal" href="psconvert.html"><span class="doc">psconvert</span></a> is a front-end to ghostscript and
pre-selects the optimal options for ghostscript that will render quality
PDF and images.</p>
<p>The PSL is fully 64-bit compliant. Integer parameters are here
specified by the type <strong>long</strong> to distinguish them from the 32-bit
<strong>int</strong>. Note that under standard 32-bit compilation they are
equivalent. Users of this library under 64-bit mode must make sure they
pass proper <strong>long</strong> variables (under Unix flavors) or <strong>__int64</strong>
under Windows 64.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="units">
<h2>Units<a class="headerlink" href="#units" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PSL can be instructed to use centimeters, inches, meters or points
as input units for the coordinates and sizes of elements to be plotted.
Any dimension that takes this setting as a unit is specified as <em>user
units</em> or <em>plot units</em> in this manual. Excluded from this are line
widths and font sizes which are always measured in <em>points</em>. The user
units can be further refined by calling <strong>PSL_beginaxes</strong>, giving the
user the opportunity to specify any linear coordinate frame. Changing
the coordinate frame only affects the coordinates of plotted material
indicated as measured in <em>plot units</em>, not the sizes of symbols (which
remain in <em>user units</em>), nor line widths or font sizes (which remain in
<em>points</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="color">
<h2>Color<a class="headerlink" href="#color" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PSL uses the direct color model where red, green, and blue are given
separately, each must be in the range from 0-1. If red = -1 then no fill
operation takes place. If red = -3, then pattern fill will be used, and
the green value will indicate the pattern to be used. Most plot-items
can be plotted with or without outlines. If outline is desired (i.e.,
set to 1), it will be drawn using the current line width and pattern.
PSL uses highly optimized macro substitutions and scales the
coordinates depending on the resolution of the hardcopy device so that
the output file is kept as compact as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="justification">
<h2>Justification<a class="headerlink" href="#justification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Text strings, text boxes and images can be “justified” by specifying the
corner to which the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates of the subroutine call
apply. Nine different values are possible, as shown schematically in
this diagram:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>9------------10----------- 11</p>
<p>|                         |</p>
<p>5             6             7</p>
<p>|                          |</p>
<p>1------------ 2------------ 3</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The box represents the text or image. E.g., to plot a text string with
its center at (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>), you must use <em>justify</em> == 6. <em>justify</em> == 0
means “no justification”, which generally means (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) is at the
bottom left. Convenience values PSL_NONE, PSL_BL, PSL_BC, PSL_BL,
PSL_ML, PSL_MC, PSL_MR, PSL_TL, PSL_TC and PSL_TR are available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initialization">
<h2>Initialization<a class="headerlink" href="#initialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These functions initialize or terminate the PSL system. We use the
term PSL session to indicate one instance of the PSL system (a
complicated program could run many PSL sessions concurrently as each
would operate via its own control structure). During a single session,
one or more plots may be created. Here are the functions involved in
initialization:</p>
<p><strong>struct PSL_CTRL *New_PSL_Ctrl</strong> (<strong>char</strong> <em>*session</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This is the first function that must be called as it creates a new
PSL session. Specifically, it will allocate a new PSL
control structure and initialize the session default parameters. The
pointer that is returned must be passed to all subsequent PSL
functions.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>long *PSL_beginsession</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*PSL</em>, <strong>long</strong>
<em>search</em>, <strong>char</strong> <em>*sharedir</em>, <strong>char</strong> <em>*userdir</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This is the second function that must be called as it initializes
the new PSL session. Here, <em>search</em> is an integer that is passed
as 0 in GMT but should be 1 for other users. If so we will search
for the environmental parameters PSL_SHAREDIR and PSL_USERDIR
should the corresponding arguments <em>sharedir</em> and <em>userdir</em> be NULL.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>long PSL_endsession</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*PSL</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This function terminates the active PSL session; it is the last
function you must call in your program. Specifically, this function
will deallocate memory used and free up resources.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>struct PSL_CTRL *PSL_beginlayer</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*PSL</em>,
<strong>long</strong> <em>layer</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Adds a DSC comment by naming this layer; give a unique integer
value. Terminate layer with PSL_endlayer</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>struct PSL_CTRL *PSL_endlayer</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*PSL</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Terminate current layer with a DSC comment.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>long PSL_fopen</strong> (<strong>char</strong> <em>*file</em>, <strong>char</strong> <em>*mode</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This function simply opens a file, just like fopen. The reason it is
replicated here is that under Windows, file pointers must be
assigned within the same DLL as they are being used. Yes, this is
retarded but if we do not do so then PSL will not work well under
Windows. Under non-Windows this functions is just a macro that
becomes fopen.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>void PSL_free</strong> (<strong>void</strong> <em>*ptr</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This function frees up the memory allocated inside PSL.
Programmers using C/C++ should now this is a macro and there is no
need to cast the pointer to <em>void *</em> as this will be done by the
macro. Fortran programmers should instead call
<strong>PSL_freefunction</strong>.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>void PSL_beginaxes</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*PSL</em>, <strong>double</strong> <em>llx</em>,
<strong>double</strong> <em>lly</em>, <strong>double</strong> <em>width</em>, <strong>double</strong> <em>height</em>, <strong>double</strong>
<em>x0</em>, <strong>double</strong> <em>y0</em>, <strong>double</strong> <em>x1</em>, <strong>double</strong> <em>y1</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This function sets up the mapping that takes the users data
coordinates and converts them to the positions on the plot in
PostScript units. This should be used when plotting data
coordinates and is terminated with <strong>PSL_endaxes</strong>, which returns
PSL to the default measurement units and scaling. Here, <em>llx</em>
and <em>lly</em> sets the lower left position of the mapping region, while
<em>width</em> and <em>height</em> sets the dimension of the plot area in user
units. Finally, <em>x0</em>, <em>x1</em> and <em>y0</em>, <em>y1</em> indicate the range of the
users x- and y-coordinates, respectively. Specify a reverse axis
direction (e.g., to let the y-axis be positive down) by setting <em>y0</em>
larger than <em>y1</em>, and similarly for an x-axis that increases to the
left.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>void PSL_endaxes</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*PSL</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Terminates the map scalings initialized by <strong>PSL_beginaxes</strong> and
returns PSL to standard scaling in measurement units.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>long PSL_beginplot</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*P</em>, <strong>FILE</strong> <em>*fp</em>,
<strong>long</strong> <em>orientation</em>, <strong>long</strong> <em>overlay</em>, <strong>long</strong> <em>color_mode</em>,
<strong>char</strong> <em>origin</em>[], <strong>double</strong> <em>offset</em>[], <strong>double</strong>
<em>page_size</em>[], <strong>char</strong> <em>*title</em>, <strong>long</strong> <em>font_no</em>[])</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Controls the initiation (or continuation) of a particular plot
within the current session. Pass file pointer <em>fp</em> where the
PostScript code will be written; if NULL then the output is
written to <em>stdout</em>. The Fortran interface always sends to <em>stdout</em>.
If you want to receive the PostScript back in memory then you need
to add PSL_MEMORY to <em>orientation</em> and call <strong>PSL_getplot</strong> to retrieve
the plot after you finish the plot with <strong>PSL_endplot</strong>.
The <em>orientation</em> may be landscape (PSL_LANDSCAPE or 0) or portrait
(PSL_PORTRAIT or 1). Set <em>overlay</em> to PSL_OVERLAY (0) if the
following PostScript code should be appended to an existing plot;
otherwise pass PSL_INIT (1) to start a new plot.
Let <em>colormode</em> be one of PSL_RGB (0), PSL_CMYK
(1), PSL_HSV (2) or PSL_GRAY (3); this setting controls how colors
are presented in the PostScript code. The <em>origin</em> setting
determines for x and y separately the origin of the specified
offsets (next argument). Each of the two characters are either <strong>r</strong>
for an offset relative to the current origin, <strong>a</strong> for a temporary
adjustment of the origin which is undone during BD(PSL_endplot),
<strong>f</strong> for a placement of the origin relative to the lower left corner
of the page, <strong>c</strong> for a placement of the origin relative to the
center of the page. The array <em>offset</em> specifies the offset of the
new origin relative to the position indicated by <strong>origin</strong>.
<em>page_size</em> means the physical width and height of the plotting
media in points (typically 612 by 792 for Letter or 595 by 842 for
A4 format). The character string <em>title</em> can be used to specify the
<strong>%%Title:</strong> header in the PostScript file (or use NULL for the
default). The array <em>font_no</em> specifies all fonts used in the plot
(by number), or use NULL to leave out the
<strong>%%DocumentNeededResources:</strong> comment in the PostScript file.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>long PSL_endplot</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*P</em>, <strong>long</strong> <em>last_page</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Terminates the plotting sequence and closes plot file (if other than
<em>stdout</em>). If <em>last_page</em> == PSL_FINALIZE
(1), then a PostScript <em>showpage</em> command
is issued, which initiates the printing process on hardcopy devices.
Otherwise, pass PSL_OVERLAY (0).</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>long PSL_setorigin</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*P</em>, <strong>double</strong>
<em>xorigin</em>, <strong>double</strong> <em>yorigin</em>, <strong>double</strong> <em>angle</em>, <strong>long</strong> <em>mode</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Changes the coordinate system by translating by
(<em>xorigin</em>,<em>yorigin</em>) followed by a <em>angle</em>-degree rotation
(<em>mode</em>=PSL_FWD or 0) or alternatively the rotation followed by
translation (<em>mode</em>=PSL_INV or 1).</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="memory-output">
<h2>Memory Output<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Normally, PSL will write all PostScript to the designated file stream
set in <strong>PSL_beginplot</strong>.  Alternatively, PSL can write all the PostScript
to an internal char * buffer which can be retrieved at the end of the plotting.
This mode can be enabled on a plot-by-plot basis by adding the flag <strong>PSL_MEMORY</strong>
to the variable <em>orientation</em> passed to <strong>PSL_beginplot</strong>.  Once we reach the
end of the plot with <strong>PSL_endplot</strong> the buffer will be available (see below).
One function provide the functionality for memory output.</p>
<p><strong>char * PSL_getplot</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*P</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Retrieves the pointer to the PostScript plot that is kept in memory
when <strong>PSL_beginplot</strong> was instructed to use memory rather than
stream output.  Note: It is the responsibility of the programmer to
ensure that the object retrieved is duplicated or written or otherwise
processed before the next call to <strong>PSL_beginplot</strong> or <strong>PSL_endsession</strong>
either of which will destroy the memory pointed to.</div></blockquote>

<h2><a class="reference external" href="#toc6">Changing Settings</a><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following functions are used to change various PSL settings and

<p><strong>long PSL_define_pen</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*P</em>, <strong>char</strong>
<em>*name</em>, <strong>long</strong> <em>width</em>, <strong>char</strong> <em>*style</em>, <strong>double</strong> <em>offset</em>,

<blockquote>
<div>Stores the specified pen characteristics in a PostScript variable
called <em>name</em>. This can be used to place certain pen attributes in

<blockquote>
<div>Sets the current color for all stroked (mode = PSL_IS_STROKE (0))

green and blue values in the range 0.0 through 1.0. Set the red
color to -3.0 and the green color to the pattern number returned by
<strong>PSL_setpattern</strong> to select a pattern as current paint color. For
PDF transparency, set <em>rgb</em>[3] to a value between 0 (opaque) and 1

<blockquote>
<div>Sets up the specified image pattern as the fill to use for polygons
and symbols. Here, <em>image_no</em> is the number of the standard PSL
fill patterns (1-90; use a negative number when you specify an image
<em>filename</em> instead. The scaling (i.e., resolution in dots per inch)
of the pattern is controlled by the image <em>dpi</em>; if set to 0 it will
be plotted at the device resolution. The two remaining settings
apply to 1-bit images only and are otherwise ignored: You may
replace the foreground color (the set bits) with the <em>f_rgb</em> color
and the background color (the unset bits) with <em>b_rgb</em>.
Alternatively, pass either color with the red component set to -1.0
and we will instead issue an image mask that is see-through for the
specified fore- or background component. To subsequently use the
pattern as a pen or fill color, use <strong>PSL_setcolor</strong> or

smaller at the expense of less color resolution. Still, a value of 2

<blockquote>
<div>Plots a simple geometric symbol centered on plot coordinates (<em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>). The argument <em>symbol</em> selects the geometric symbol to use.
Most symbols are scaled to fit inside a circle of diameter given as
<em>size</em>[0], but some symbols take additional parameters. Choose
from these 1-parameter symbols using the predefined self-explanatory
integer values PSL_CIRCLE, PSL_DIAMOND, PSL_HEXAGON,
PSL_INVTRIANGLE, PSL_OCTAGON, PSL_PENTAGON, PSL_SQUARE,
PSL_STAR, and PSL_TRIANGLE; these may all be filled and stroked if
<strong>PSL_setfill</strong> has been called first. In addition, you can choose
several line-only symbols that cannot be filled. They are
PSL_CROSS, PSL_DOT, PSL_PLUS, PSL_XDASH, and PSL_YDASH.
Finally, more complicated symbols require more than one parameter to
be passed via <em>size</em>. These are PSL_ELLIPSE (<em>size</em> is expected to
contain the three parameter <em>angle</em>, <em>major</em>, and <em>minor</em> axes,
which defines an ellipse with its major axis rotated by <em>angle</em>
degrees), PSL_MANGLE (<em>size</em> is expected to contain the 10
parameters <em>radius</em>, <em>angle1</em>, and <em>angle2</em> for the math angle
specification, followed by <em>tailwidth</em>, <em>headlength</em>, <em>headwidth</em>,
<em>shape</em>, <em>status</em>, <em>trim1</em> and <em>trim2</em> (see PSL_VECTOR below for explanation),
PSL_WEDGE (<em>size</em> is expected to contain the three parameter

Here (<em>x_tip</em>,<em>y_tip</em>) are
the coordinates to the head of the vector, while (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) are
those of the tail. <em>shape</em> can take on values from 0-1 and specifies
how far the intersection point between the base of a straight vector
head and the vector line is moved toward the tip. 0.0 gives a
triangular head, 1.0 gives an arrow shaped head. The <em>status</em> value
is a bit-flag being the sum of several possible contributions:
PSL_VEC_RIGHT (2) = only draw right half
of vector head, PSL_VEC_BEGIN (4) =
place vector head at beginning of vector,
PSL_VEC_END (8) = place vector head at end of vector,
PSL_VEC_JUST_B (0) = align vector beginning at (x,y),
PSL_VEC_JUST_C (16) = align vector center at (x,y),
PSL_VEC_JUST_E (32) = align vector end at (x,y),
PSL_VEC_JUST_S (64) = align vector center at (x,y),
PSL_VEC_OUTLINE (128) = draw vector head outline using default
pen, PSL_VEC_FILL (512) = fill vector head using default fill,
PSL_VEC_MARC90 (2048) = if angles subtend 90, draw straight angle
symbol (PSL_MANGLE only). The symbol may be filled and its outline
stroked depending on the current settings for fill and pen
attributes.  The parameters <em>head1</em> and <em>head2</em> determines
what kind of vector head will be plotted at the two ends (if selected).
0 = normal vector head, 1 = circle, 2 = terminal crossbar.

negative, then all leading and trailing blanks are stripped before
plotting. Certain character sequences (flags) have special meaning
to <strong>PSL_plottext</strong>. &#64;~ toggles between current font and the
Mathematical Symbols font. &#64;%<em>no</em>% selects font <em>no</em> while &#64;%%
resets to the previous font. &#64;- turns subscript on/off, &#64;+ turns
superscript on/off, &#64;# turns small caps on/off, and &#64;\ will make a
composite character of the following two character. &#64;;<em>r/g/b</em>;

<em>fontsize</em> in points. Normally, the text is typed using solid
characters in the current color (set by <strong>PSL_setcolor</strong>). To draw
outlined characters, set <em>mode</em> == 1; the outline will get the
current color and the text is filled with the current fill color
(set by <strong>PSL_setfill</strong>). Use <em>mode</em> == 2 if the current fill is a
pattern. Use <em>mode</em> == 3 to achieve the same as <em>mode</em> == 1, while
preventing the outline from obsuring any filled text font; the outline
will hence be reduced to half the selected width. If the text is not
filled, <em>mode</em> == 3 operates the same as <em>mode</em> == 1.

<div>Please text along one or more path segments. The function does
different things depending on the bit flags in <em>mode</em>. A key
distinction occurs if the bit flag contains the bit PSL_TXT_CURVED
(64) which means we wish to typeset the text along a variable and curved
baseline given by the segments in <em>xpath, ypath</em>; otherwise we set
straight text (possibly at an angle) and the <em>xpath, ypath</em> are
not considered for text placement [If no line drawing is desired
then these two arrays may be NULL].  We will describe the action
taken for each bit value.  Multiple values may be passed at the
same time and we processes from low to hight bit.
PSL_TXT_INIT: When mode contains this bit (1) we will initialize
all the required variables and store them in the PostScript file.
PSL_TXT_SHOW: We wish to see the text strings (otherwise they may
only serve as guides to set up clip paths).
PSL_TXT_CLIP_ON: Use the text and the paths to set up clip paths.
PSL_TXT_DRAW: Draw the lines defined by the <em>xpath, ypath</em> arrays.
PSL_TXT_CLIP_OFF: Turn the text path clipping off.
We pass the text strings via <em>text</em>.  The locations of text plotting
depends on whether PSL_TXT_CURVED is selected.  If it is then
you must pass as <em>arg1</em> the <em>node</em> array indicating at which
node in the <em>xpath, ypath</em> array the text will be plotted; let
<em>arg2</em> be NULL. For
straight baselines you must instead pass another set of x,y
coordinates with the locations of the text label placements

Each label has its own entry in the

PSL_TXT_FILLBOX (128) will fill the text box (this requires you

PSL_TXT_DRAWBOX (256) will draw the text box outlines (this requires

<p>Here are functions used to issue comments or to pass custom PostScript
commands directly to the output PostScript file. In C these functions
are declared as macros and they can accept a variable number of
arguments. However, from FORTRAN only a single text argument may be
passed.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>long PSL_setcommand</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*P</em>, <strong>char</strong> <em>*text</em>)</dt>
<dd>Writes a raw PostScript command to the PostScript output file,
e.g., “1 setlinejoin.</dd>
<dt><strong>long PSL_comment</strong> (<strong>struct PSL_CTRL</strong> <em>*P</em>, <strong>char</strong> <em>*text</em>)</dt>
<dd>Writes a comment (<em>text</em>) to the PostScript output file, e.g.,
“Start of graph 20. The comment are prefixed with with %% .</dd>
