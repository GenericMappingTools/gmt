-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-05-02	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT can now be used to set column-specific
				formats using comma-separated <cols>:<format> specifications.
				The last format without leading <cols>: overrides the default
				format for all unspecified columns.

2011-05-02	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		Fixed problems with custom page size.
	* pslib.c:		Removed incorrect increase count of clipping when placing
				curved labels.

2011-05-01	pwessel
	* job03.sh:		Replaced complicated awk scripting with gmtmath to ensure
				we get the common sampling range which changed by a tad
				due to the bug in project.
	* gmt_init.c:		New -b syntax to allow for mixed-type records on i/o.
	* gmt_io.c:		New binary i/o processing to allow separate types for each column.

	* gmt_common.h:		Removed common.b.netcdf and put common.b.varnames under GMT_COMPAT
	* gmt_io.c, gmt_init.c:	Option -bic no longer refers to netCDF files. -bic?varnames still
				allowed for backwards compatibility; use file?varnames instead.
				NetCDF table file automatically recognised.

2011-04-29	remko
	* job04*.sh:		Made ex 4 and 4c more similar and rotated color bar.

	* gmt_plot.c:		Rotate annotations by 180 degrees when "seen from North" in 3D.

2011-04-26	pwessel
	* grdblend_func.c:	Can now take a list of grids (e.g., *.nc) instead of the

	* gmt_support.c:	All boundcond functions modified as old structs EDGEINFO and
				BCR are simplified into a few parameters in the GRDHEADER,
				eliminating overhead.
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Grid boundary conditions are applied immediately after the read
				stage, so all program reading grids will have correct boundary
				rows/cols already set.
				Now we use data BCs is at least one of the edges in a subset grid
				can be extended to include original data.
	* *.c:			All programs needing grid interpolation no longer have to explicitly
				parse, init, and set boundary conditions.

2011-04-25	remko

				that can be used to change grid interpolation parameters.
				Replaces a mix of -S, -Q, -L options across many programs.
				Those -L -Q -S options are still processed under compatibility mode.
	* Option -s:		New modifier a (i.e., -sa) to suppress output of any data record
				where one or more fields equal NaN.
	* grdtrack_func.c:	Replaced -S with common option -sa (backwards compatible).

2011-04-24	remko
	* GMT_App_N.sh:		Remove GMT_Appendix_N_1.tex when empty.
	* gmt_grdio.c (GMT_grd_setregion):	Return value now 0, 1, 2 instead of 1, 0, 0;

	* gmt_init.c:		Replaced GMT_getparameter by GMT_putparameter, avoiding requirement to
				set size of "value" accurately.
				Complete rewrite of GMT_savedefaults, using GMT_putparameter to

2011-01-25	jluis
	* grdfilter_func.c	Implemented OpenMP parallelization after GMT4 code provided
				by Dan Kokron. Modifications are #ifdefed and will be used

	* triangulate_func.c:	Did not use projected coordinates when -R -J was given.

2011-01-09	remko

2011-01-04	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_cspline should initialize c[0] = c[n-1] = 0.0 in case
				it is called repeatedly [not the case in GMT].
2011-01-03	pwessel
	* grdproject_func.c:	The -N is now obsolete (backwards compatible as in grdsample)
				since -D can set nx/ny if requested.
	* autoconf.ac:		Moving to use GSHHS 2.1.1 for next release.
	* gmt_shore.c:		---"---

2010-12-31	pwessel

2010-12-13	pwessel
	* project_func.c:	The -Dg|d is made obsolete (under GMT_COMPAT) but did not work
				anyway since output is entirely controlled by FORMAT_GEO_OUT.
	* pswiggle_func.c:	The gap -D is made obsolete (under GMT_COMPAT) as that functionality
				is provided by the universal -g option.
	* pshistogram_func.c:	The -T<col> option is made obsolete (under GMT_COMPAT) as we
				now have the universal -i<col> option.

2010-12-13	jluis

2010-11-25	pwessel
	* share/doc/gmt/examples/Makefile:
	* doc/scripts/GMT_RGBchart.sh:

	* Misc *.c:		Applied patches from Florian Wobbe fixing minor scripting
				omissions and a few dozen warnings.

2010-11-23	pwessel
	* grdmask_func.c:	Must skip "polygons" with less than 3 points.  Also, the

	* gmt_io.c:		Same

2010-11-19	pwessel
	* gmtselect_func.c:	Due to resampling of parallels in -N, some points exactly on
				a coast bin parallel could fail the test due to roundoff.
				Fixed by not resampling coastlines since it is a Cartesian test.
				Added -Efn to change how boundary points are treated [Default
				considers them to be inside].  Place the old -N...[o] under
				GMT_COMPAT check.
	* grdlandmask_func.c:	Same.

2010-11-18	pwessel
	* gmt_esri_io.c:	Must look for both nodata_value and NODATA_value, apparently.
	* xyz2grd_func.c:	Failed if -Evalue was given and the ESRI grid already had a
				nodata_value line.  Now will process this line, if present.
				The value given on the command line will override any setting
				found in the file. [Note: -E is only available in GMT_COMPAT mode].
				Also made string-checks case-insensitive.
	* gmt_map.c:		We have a safety valve for preventing a painful slow search
				around the map perimeter.  The search is appropriate for maps
				but not for mapproject results.  The limit was for 200 inch
				wide maps == 14400p.  A user ran pscoast with 14401p and was
				caught.  Now check for 400 inch and also check if PSL has
				been initiated. If not then it is probably a projection job.
	* gmtselect_func.c:	Need to pass GMT_IO_ASCII model to GMT_Get_Data to ensure
				the -C, -F, -L files are read as ASCII regardless of what
				the input data source is.

				if -fg; otherwise Cartesian.  use new operator DEG2KM to
				convert spherical degrees to km.

2010-11-15	pwessel
	* grdtrack_func.c:	New options -Clength/dx[/spacing] to automatically create
				cross-profiles normal to the given line segments.  Also
				given -Am|p to affect resampling of paths, and -D<dfile>
				to save the resampled original line (with dist/az appended).
	* grdproject_func.c:	Now assign proper x/y units.
	* grdsample_func.c:	Did not use -R value when given.
	* imgsrc/img2grd_func.c:	Many bug fixes. Now works.

				in the file and thus know the number of columns.  Allow
				for backwards compatibility (skip the users ncols).
	* sample1d_func.c:	Did not have -A[m|p] option.

2010-11-10	pwessel
	* nearneighbor_func.c:	Changed default to a more reasonable -N4/2.

	* meca/utilmeca.c:	Fix bug affecting the plot of P & T axis
	* meca/psmeca_func.c:	Fix a few issues in -a option.
				T_axes marker was white instead of black.

2010-11-08	jluis
	* gmt_plot.c:		Wrap the fp assignement in GMT_plotinit with a #ifdef WIN32
				to avoid another cross DLL issue.

2009-11-27	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		The old +gmtdefaults mechanism is no longer supported.

	* gmt_init.c:		Modified GMT_begin to also initialize PSL, then parse
				GMT/PSL defaults.  Split gmt_history into gmt_get_history
				which is called by GMT_begin at start of session. History
				is maintained via GMT->init.history and updated by the
				GMT_Complete_Options via GMT_Sort_Options.  This replaces
				-R with the latest -Rw/e/s/n, etc.  Then, GMT_Destroy_Session
				calls GMT_end which calls gmt_put_history which finally
				writes out the new .gmtcommands listing.
				Also parse .gmtcommands PSL defaults directly into the PSL struct
				if it is not NULL.
	* gmtdefaults_func.c:	Now moved to "PSL" programs since it must be able to parse PSL.
	* gmtset_func.c:	---"---

				in PSL_plotarc. Only issue setlinecap/setlinejoin/setmiterlimit
				when actually changed.
	* pscoast_func.c:	No longer relies on traps in pslib.
				Reuse recursive code both for filling and clipping.
				No longer suggests it is clipping while it is filling.

	* spotter/backtracker.c:	Needed GMT_LONG variables to be passed to GMT libs
	* spotter/hotspotter.c:		Needed GMT_LONG variables to be passed to GMT libs
	* spotter/originator.c:		Needed GMT_LONG variables to be passed to GMT libs

2009-09-11	remko
	* gmtdefaults_*.in:	Enter TRANSPARENCY = 0; replaced color triplets by names.
	* gmt_init.c:		Let gmtdefaults output TRANSPARENCY and print colors as names
				if available.
	* gmt_support.c:	Added GMT_getrgb_index to get index of preset RGB triplets.
	* gmt_{init,map.c}:	When using -JX, give width or height as 0 and it will adjust to
				the scale of the other (keeping aspect ratio).

2009-09-10	pwessel
	* grdcontour.c:		The -L option was not used in limiting contours.

2009-09-10	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		Introduced option to make material transparent using the
				--TRANSPARENCY setting (or gmtset TRANSPARENCY). Can be viewed
				with Adobe Distiller (only?).
	* gmt_plot.c, gmtdefaults.txt, gmt.h, gmt_globals.h, gmt_keywords.d:	---"---
	* psclip.c, pscoast.c:	Replaced booleans GMT_ps.clip_on and GMT_ps.clip_off with single
				GMT_ps.clip with values -1, 0 or +1.
	* configure.ac, all makefiles:	Needed to redo the way GDAL_INC and GDAL_LIB are inserted.
				-I (without anything) of -L (without anything) when GDAL is not
				enabled makes compiling impossible. So *_LIB and *_INC (also
				NETCDF) now include the -I and -L/-l flags.

2009-09-10	jluis
	* mgd77/mgd77magref.c:	It now lets the Core field be computed with the IGRF and added
				to the atmospheric sources calculated with CM4. We added
				this because the secular variation in CM4 is limited to 2002.5
				but the "atmospheric coefficients" can be continuously updated

2009-09-09	pwessel
	* LICENSE.TXT:		Replaced file COPYING with LICENSE.TXT and clarified we are
	  			using GPL v2 as displayed in all source files.
	* GSHHS*:		Updated to GSHHS 2.0.1 so new pscoast options can work
	* configure.ac:		Added --enable-gdal[=dir] for experimental GDAL grid import
				functionality for reading GDAL-supported grids (one band) and
				plotting of geotiff via grdimage

2009-09-08	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77magref.c:	Got wrong time as time initialization had changed but
				not implemented in this program.
	* misc/gmt2kml.c:	-T did not handle spaces in titles and folder names

2009-09-07	jluis
	* gmt_customio.[ch]:	Added the optional GDAL interface as format 22
	* gmtinstall.bat:	Now has rules to optionally compile the GDAL interface

2009-09-07	remko
	* minmax.c:		Bug fix: -EH did not work

2009-09-06	pwessel
	* gmt_customio.c:	Made surfer grid header i/o 64-bit compliant

2009-09-06	jluis
	* nc2xy.c:		Added -b option (of which only -bo makes sense)

2009-09-06	remko
	* configure.ac:		Now use --enable-flock to enable file locking, instead of
				--disable-flock to disable if.
				Use --enable-64 to force 64-bit compilation, use --disable-64
				to force 32-bit compilation. Otherwise use default.
				Switch -DGMT_QSORT on only for OSX prior to Snow Leopard.

2009-09-04	pwessel
	* gmt.h:		Now has GMT_abs macro that handles abs/labs use

2009-09-04	remko
	* gmt_map.[ch]:		Changed GMT_truncate from being a pointer function (PFL)
				to a regular function that simply calls GMT_truncate_x
				or GMT_truncate_tm depending on whether projection is TM.
				This to avoid problems with calling GMT_truncate with
				constant argument -1 in 64-bit machines.
	* gmt_shore.c, psmask.c, gmt.h, gmt_globals.h:	---"---
	* pscoast.c:		Added mention of debugging options when DEBUG is on.
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_log_array: Recoded to avoid 64-bit error (last value was not
				included).
				GMT_pow_array, GMT_log_array: Simplified code.
				GMT_memory: Now free memory when reallocating memory with size 0.

2009-08-27	jluis
	* gmt_gdalread.[ch]:	Wrapper function to interface with the GDAL library
	* grdimage.c:		Modified (with #ifdefs) to allow minimalist images import
				using GDAL, via the gmt_gdalread function.
	* gmt_support.c:	Fixed bug in x_inc adjust. It was cosd (0.5 * (h->x_min + h->x_max))
				Instead of cosd (0.5 * (h->y_min + h->y_max))

2009-08-20	remko
	* pslib.c, pslib_inc.h:	ps_place_color now also adds the "set...color" operator, so
				that PSL->internal.paint_code could be removed.

2009-08-17	remko
	* gmt_plot.c, GMT_Chapter_{3,6}.tex:	Documentation on -JPoly added.
	* gmt_map.c:		Made frame and annotation of polyconic work properly.
	* {x2sys,mgd77,mgg}/makefile:	Solved problems with install/uninstall and missing *.h
				files in distro.

2009-08-15	remko
	* gmt_proj.[ch], gmt_map.c, gmt_init.c:	First stab at introducing polyconic projection.
				Not documented yet, but seems to work (-JPoly).

2009-07-24	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	The routine that checks if a points is inside or outside a
				polar cap had trouble when the points longitude exactly
				equalled a point on the polygon since round-off would
				cause our test to fail.  Now hopefully fool-proof.
2009-07-23	pwessel
	* psmask.c:		With -D, the internal di,dj constant was set way too large.

2009-07-22	pwessel
	* gmt_shore.[ch]:	The -A+r|+l option was premature as more info in the GSHHS
				netcdf files are needed to properly skip features.  GSHHS 2.0.1
				will have this information so pscoast et al need to check
				for versions before attempting to use any of the +<modifiers>

2009-07-18	mtchandl
	* mgd77/mgd77sniffer.c:	Bug in -I option; needed to set bitpattern for bad faa.

2009-07-18	remko
	* pslib.c, pslib_inc.h:		Added option to reduce all color to gray scale.
	* gmt_init.c, gmtdefaults.txt:	Added setting PS_COLOR = gray.

2009-07-15
	* GMT 4.5.0 finalized and released
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2009-07-13	pwessel
	* surface.c:		When data lie exactly on a plane and -L was used, surface tried to free memory
				for constraints that never needed to be allocated.
2009-07-10	pwessel
	* gmt_suppl.html:	Add all the new supplement programs to the HTML doc page.
	* *.c:			Handle error codes so as to not raise the wrath of Ubuntu

2009-07-10	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		GMT_font_lookup now understands font numbers too.
	* psscale.c:		Added -Aa and -Al options to move only the annotations or label to the
				other side of the color bar. When using -A on horizontal bar, the last
				tick mark would not appear. Require -Ac to keep the column plotting
				of vertical labels.
	* pslegend.c:		Make font height dependent on actual font used.

2009-07-09	pwessel
	* gmt_mgg_header2.c:	Can now handle float grids, and properly handles byte-order swapping in input.
	* segyprogs/pssegy.c:	Casting as long forced 8 rather than 4-byte offsets. Thanx to Adrian Benson.
	* segyprogs/pssegyz.c:	Casting as long forced 8 rather than 4-byte offsets.
	* segyprogs/segy2grd.c:	Casting as long forced 8 rather than 4-byte offsets.

2009-07-09	remko
	* psclip.c:		Produce warning when using -B in combination with -N or -T.
				Better reuse of code.
	* psclip.txt:		Explained even-odd rule.
	* psxy.{c,txt}:		Added -T option. Equivalent to adding /dev/null (or NUL on Windows).
	* pslegend.c, anim01.sh:	Make use of new psxy -T option.

2009-07-08	pwessel
	* sph/sphtriangulate.c:	Must turn -mo on when -T is selected.

2009-07-07	pwessel
	* gmt_plot.c:		The polar cap on gridlines needed to be reversed for r-theta (polar) maps

2009-07-07	remko
	* gmt_support.c (GMT_RI_prepare):	Fixed bug: when x_inc in km, m, etc,
				value was ignored (always 1).

2009-07-05	pwessel
	* grdimage.c:		For -Q we now make sure the NaN-color is unique.

2009-07-04	jluis
	* gmtsuppl.bat:		Add x2sys_list x2sys_report x2sys_solve & x2sys_merge to the x2sys section

2009-07-02	remko

2009-07-01	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77sniffer.c:	Did not reset the E77 structure between cruises.
	* mgd77/mgd77list.c:	Modifier -At added which attempts to create fake cruise times
				based on header information and distance along track.

2009-06-30	pwessel
	* grdfilter.c:		Toggle -T was not processed correctly if -Rgridfile was given.
	* mgd77list.c:		Output relative time did not use GMT's --TIME_*

2009-06-27	remko
	* gmt_init.c (GMT_history):	No longer remove supposedly empty .gmtcommands4 file.
				Could have been written to by piped GMT command. Now create/write
				only when new matter is to be written.

2009-06-25	pwessel
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Change for reasonable x/y range if units has the words "longitude"
				or "latitude" before concluding we have geodetic coordinates.
	* gmt_support.c:	The modifier :<radius>[unit] to the -G option in grdcontour for
				the placement of contour labels is now +r<radius>[unit] since the
				colon interfered with ddd:mm:ss coordinates.

2009-06-24	jluis
	* x2sys/x2sys_merge.c:	New program to merge updated COEs table into a main COE table database
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Do not use any GMT_XXX to access ascii files on creation/writing so that
				it can work on Windows as well (improvement on 2009-06-07 changes).

2009-06-24	pwessel
	* ps2raster.c:		Exceeded memory allocation for out_file.  Now in static memory.

2009-06-24	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		Do not crash if a name with extension is given to -F (rip the extension)

2009-06-23	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77manage.c:	-AE will ignore the verification status and process e77 anyway.
	* mgd77/mgd77path.c:	Added -P- to just list the IDs and not the full paths

2009-06-21	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	Given -I601+/601+ the y_inc was not treated correctly

2009-06-20	pwessel
	* gmt_shore.c:		Added support for the +p<percent> modifier to limit features whose
				area is less the <percent> of the corresponding full-resolution polygon

2009-06-19	pwessel
	* gmt_globals.h:	Change default ascii format to %.12g to avoid loss of precision.
				Changed default for OUTPUT_DEGREE_FORMAT to D (-180/180) so it
				is the same as that for PLOT_DEGREE_FORMAT.
2009-06-18	pwessel
	* misc/gmtstitch.c:	Enhanced -T option to eliminate connections when the 2nd closest
				pair is too close.  Also added -C option to simply separate the
				open from the closed polygons (no stitching).

2009-06-17	pwessel
	* grdfft.c:		Now also has Butterworth band-pass filter.

2009-06-17	remko
	* gmt_init.c (GMT_begin):	GMT_history should come AFTER reading defaults, otherwise
				there is no way to switch it off.
	* gmt2kml.c:		Option -R becomes -Ra (otherwise takes it from .gmtcommands4).
				Default folder name now "%s Features", where %s is feature type.
				No longer produces empty segments (when all data out of bounds).
				Create folder per input file (except standard input).
				Ignore -C option when plotting lines or polygons.
	* gmt2kml.txt:		Added example of document hierarchy.

2009-06-16	pwessel
	* gmt2kml.{c,txt}:	-T now takes title and optionally folder name.  When -O or -K is used
				we always group features into folders and each folder has their own
				style settings.

2009-06-16	remko
	* gmtmath.c:		Fixed bug: tried to free memory that was not allocated.
	* gmt_io.c:		Allow specifying both -mi and -mo.
	* gmt2kml.{c,txt}:	Removed altitude argument of -E (had no purpose). Set default pen to 1,
				as specified.  Changed -AA to -Aa, inline with -Ag and -As.
				Altitude argument of -A becomes default altitude.  Fixed error with -Gn.
				Always write linestyle and polygon style (need for extrusion).
				Moved <extrude> and <altitudeMode> within <feature></feature>.
				Write out <gx:altitudeMode> when required.
				Removed -AG, -AS; use -Ag0, -As0 instead. Allow vertical scaling.
				Removed -F<capital>, altitude mode is now fully controlled by -A.
				Put set of points in a folder automatically.
				Label line segments automatically.  Improved documentation.
				Renamed option -L to -R, which now also performs data screening.
				Renamed option -C to -L. Added -C option to color icons by value.
				Added option to scale altitude values.
				Made to work with binary and netCDF files.

2009-06-15	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		Allow negative integer interval (-n) for annotating log axis; this means
				annotate every n'th power of 10.
	* misc/gmtstitch.c:	Now honors -V properly.

2009-06-11	remko
	* gmt_nc.c:		No longer write node_offset = 0 to file (not essential, only confusing).
	* gmt_grdio.c:		GMT_grd_setregion now includes "interpolant" argument: this ensures
				enough padding (if available) from the input grid and no blank edges
				on left and/or right side of the map.
				More appropriate coding of GMT_grd_shift.
				GMT_adjust_loose_wesn now includes test on data domain (moved from main
				programs calling it).
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_RI_prepare recoded. Possibly safer. Need to investigate if it can
				be skipped when nx and ny already set.
	* grd2xyz.c:		Area check moved to GMT_adjust_loose_wesn.
	* grdvector.c, grdrotater.c, grdview.c, grdcontour.c, grdimage.c:
				Extra argument in GMT_grd_setregion. No more subset checks needed.

2009-06-09	pwessel
	* misc/gmtdp.c:		With -m, did not write the correct multisegment header from input.

2009-06-07	jluis
	* mgd77/mgd77info.c:	Use of both printf() and internal functions that write to GMT_stdout
				seams to be incompatible on Windows. Now always use fprintf (GMT_stdout, ...)
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Open ascii files with fopen (and not GMT_fopen) because they are written
				with fprintf(F->fp, ...) and Windows, again, gets lost.

2009-06-07	remko
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Fixed bug in GMT_grd_setregion: longitudes were limited inward
				instead of outward. Caused white-space left and right in grdimage.

2009-06-03	pwessel
	* pscoast.c:		-C[l|r/]<fill> offers to paint river-lakes separately from lakes.
				The -A option can be used to exclude riverlakes or lakes for level 2.

	* explain_gshhs.txt:	New include file for man pages for programs using GSHHS.
	* gmtselect.c:		Same upgrade to -A option as pscoast
	* grdlandmask.c:	Same upgrade to -A option as pscoast
	* gmt_init.c:		New function GMT_GSHHS_syntax to explain -A option for three programs.
	* gmt_shore.c:		Now looks for a version attribute in the GSHHS file that is reported
				when pscoast -Vl is used.  New treatment of riverlakes as special lakes.
	* gshhs/gshhs.*:	Header structure format for GSHHS 1.11 has changed to include two new
				integers: parent (the id of the containing polygon, or -1), and river
				(1 if a lake is a riverlake, 0 otherwise).
	* GSHHS*:		New version 1.11 that fixes the problem with permanent rivers introduced
				after GMT 4.2.0.  Also corrects gross errors near the mouth of the
				Amazon river.  GMT works with either GSHHS 1.11 or earlier but any
				option pertaining to riverlakes are ignored with older versions.
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Converting files from netCDF to MGD77 where time = NaN gave junk records.
	* misc/dimfilter.c:	New program for directional spatial filtering.

2009-06-02	remko
	* pslegend.c:		> record no longer needed before T; T, L, S, H alignment harmonized;
				I, M, B spacing improved; -B option added.

				font(size)s are used; added -B option.

2009-05-31	pwessel

	* gmt_init.c:		Do not create empty .gmtcommands4 files

2009-05-28	remko

				that using -fit and -foT would require reformatting.

2009-05-27	pwessel
	* misc/gmtstitch.c:	Did not read standard input if no files were given.

2009-05-26	pwessel
	* gmtconvert.c:		With -S, did not report the number of output segments.  Now allows
				-S~<pattern> which reports segments whose header does NOT contain pattern.
				Should pattern actually start with ~ we escape it with \~pattern.

2009-05-25	pwessel
	* greenspline.c:	Calculation of nz layers was off by one, leaving out the
				penultimate layer.

2009-05-23	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77manage.c:	Now uses GMT_read_img to handle *.img files; earlier it could
				not handle the latest +-80 degree lats.  Also passed wrong filename variable.

2009-05-21	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		When only -mi is set there should be no multisegment headers on output
					but there was no if-test to check for that.

2009-05-21	remko
	* bin/*:		Removed bin directory from CVS.
	* gmtlogo, gmtget, psbbox.sh:	Moved to src directory. Created manuals for them.
	* gmtpatch.sh:		Moved to main directory.

2009-05-20	pwessel
	* psclip.c:		New option -T that turns on map region clipping without any
				input data files.  Shorthand for -N /dev/null.
	* x2sys/x2sys_list.c:	Can now accept list of weights for each track and output the
				composite weight for each crossover.
	* x2sys/x2sys_solve.c:	Option -W means an extra column with crossover weight.

2009-05-19	pwessel
	* misc/gmt2kml.c:	New program in the misc supplement that converts GMT table
				data to KML format for Google Earth.
	* misc/kml2gmt.c:	New programs that extracts GMT data tables from Google Earth
				KML files, perhaps after editing the latter in GE.

2009-05-19	remko

				compiler also provides a sincos function)
	* mgd77/mgd77magref.c:	Use sincos()

2009-05-14	remko
	* grdinfo.{c,txt}:	Add option -L0 to actually scan data to determine zmin and zmax
	* gmt_nc.c:		Argument [layer] was not stripped from varname and would end up
				in output grid.  Set zmin/zmax to NaN when info not in header.

2009-05-13	pwessel
	* *.[ch]:		Moving to use GMT_LONG for almost all integers.

2009-05-12	remko
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_UTMzone_to_wesn):	Numerous bug fixes: Did not report bad zone
				for < A or > Z; Zones A+B reached till 84S instead of 80S; Zone J
				wrongly produced value for Zone K; Zones U+W were not recognized;
				Now also equates Zone O to Zone P (already equated Zone I to J).

2009-05-08	remko
	* gmtconvert.c:		Switch off default NaN treatment when NAN_RECORDS=pass and no
				multi-segment output is requested.
	* gmt_init.c:		Renamed GRID_FORMAT to GRIDFILE_FORMAT to avoid confusion with
				other GRID_* variables which relate to painting grids, and in
				accordance with GRIDFILE_SHORTHAND.
				GRID_FORMAT can still be used for backwards compatibility.
				Allow different units for font sizes. Default remains points.
				GMT_convert_units: add 10 to new_format to specify it as
				default unit as well.

				Sutherland/Hodgman algorithm that handles curved boundaries.
	* gmt_io.c:		GMT_DATADIR can now be a list of directories, separated by colons
				or semi-colons (Windows).
	* mgd77list.c:		Used wrong time for IGRF calculation; worst case off by 1 year.
	* mgd77manage.c:	---"---

2009-05-06	pwessel
	* *.c, *.txt, *.tex:	While remaining backwards compatible, we no longer announce that

				document the user of GMT_DATADIR and GMT_USERDIR only.

2009-05-06	remko

				use whatever <text> was set to in previous record.
	* pslegend.txt:		Changed accordingly, plus some additional polishing.
	* GMT_sealand.cpt:	Changed hue interval on one line from 0-345 to 360-345 to prevent
				wrong interpolation.

2009-05-03	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77magref.c:	New mgd77 program used to evaluate the CM4 comprehensive geomagnetic

				using the -E...+ mechanism when data were not geographic.

2009-04-29	remko
	* PSL_prologue.ps:	Changed "bind def" to "def" in function /FS. The "bind def" slowed

2009-03-24	pwessel
	* sph:			Introduce new GMT supplement sph which provide GMT-like
				front-ends for Robert Renka's Fortran SSRFPACK and STRIPACK
				libraries.  They are here translated to C via f2c and requires
				the f2c library and include file to compile and link.

				boundaries.
	* gmt_init.c:		New Default setting NAN_RECORDS = skip|pass [skip].
				If "pass" we treat let the programs handle the NaNs; for some
				programs the NaNs in input record will act as indicators of
				data gaps for continuous lines.  If "skip" we report them
				as bad records.  In both cases the records are skipped.
	* mgd77/mgd77manage.c:	Now honors NAN_RECORDS in tables given to -A.

				interval (when -W is used).

2009-03-04	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77list.c:	Now can specify -DA and -DB which, in the presence of time = NaN,
				will not output such records [-Da|b will].  Also clarified the
				ranges implied by -D/-S.
	* blockm*.c:		Gave bogus usage about number of input columns when -E is set
				but -E only affects output.  Input is always 3 or 4 cols.

2009-03-04	remko

				atand, atan2d as well as their "safe" equivalents.
	* coast/segment_connect.c:	Simplified i_great_circle_dist() by calling
				GMT_great_circle_dist().
	* gmt_map.c:		Fixed serious bug in GMT_az_backaz_flatearth: incorrectly
				converted degrees to radians. Fixed bug in GMT_get_rotate_pole:
				called GMT_rotate_pole_forward with radians instead of degrees.
				project_info.o_{beta,pole_lat,pole_lon} now in degrees.
				GMT_fix_up_path: all arithmetic now in degrees.
	* project.c:		Avoid changing variables in the control list (Ctrl);
				this may have been harmful in the future (GMT5).
				Removed "rads" argument from internal routines since it was
				always TRUE anyhow. All routines are now in degrees.
	* gmt_vector.[ch]:	GMT_geo_to_cart no longer alters the input coordinates.

				the grid domain is used to set -R as well as the grid
				increment for those program that has such an option.

2008-11-21	pwessel
	* spotter/backtracker.c:	The -W option always assumed the reverse rotation,
				i.e. from hotspot to seamount.  Now obeys the -D option.

2008-11-17	pwessel
	* psscale.c:		When -I and -Li was used we did not draw box outlines.
	* ps2raster.c:		New format -Tb for Microsoft BMP output.  Also, formats
				b, g, j, and t accept modifier '-' to produce grayscale
				images.  Finally, added -Cgs-command to add one or more
				custom switches to ghostscript, and -Q[g|t]<bits> to
				set the level of anti-aliasing for graphics and text.

2008-11-14	pwessel

	* spotter/backtracker.c:	New option -e to specify a single fixed total
				reconstruction rotation to apply to all input points.

2008-10-17	pwessel
	* xyz2grd.c:		New format (A) for -Z which allows more than one floating
				point value per input record.  Cannot be used if the z-
				values are in dateTclock or ddd:mm:ss format.
2008-10-14	pwessel
	* xgrid/xGridEdit.c:	Needs GMT_io_init to get all pieces needed to read grids.

2008-10-10	pwessel
	* x2sys.c:		Can now also handle netCDF 1-D COARDS files.
	* psbasemap.c:		The -L syntax and description was out of date regarding
				how the options are to be specified.  Added new syntax
				explain functions for both map scale and map rose so these
				are consistently described for both psbasemap and pscoast.
				Also corrected the syntax and description in the man pages.

2008-10-08	remko
	* gmtmath.c:		Added INRANGE operator. Was added to grdmath on 2004-03-28,
				but was not available to gmtmath.

2008-10-06	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_datalist.c:	Now has [experimental] support for using a correction
				table and can compute auxiliary data such as distance and az.
	* x2sys/x2sys_init.c:	Now, the dist and speed unit settings (-C -N) are set here
				and are kept with the TAG for use in other x2sys programs

2008-10-03	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_report.c:	New program [experimental] to report statistics of crossovers.

2008-09-24	pwessel

				it GMT_gauss.
	* gmt_vector.c:		Now holds general-purpose square matrix solver GMT_gauss.
				Eliminated hardwired limit on N.

2008-09-21	jluis
	* pslegend.c:		Now use remove function to delete script after completion;
				this avoids a Windows problem.

2008-09-20	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	Function GMT_get_arc did not check for division by zero.
				The -Gx<file>:<radius>[unit] in grdcontour passed the entire
				argument as the file name.
	* x2sys/x2sys_list.c:	New program [experimental] to extract a subset of crossovers
				from the list produced by x2sys_cross.  Intended to replace
				the old x_system/x_list.c.
	* x2sys/x2sys_solve.c:	New program [experimental] to determine systematic trends from
				a set of crossover errors.  Intended to replace the old
				x_system/x_solve_dc_drift.c.

2008-09-10	remko
	* gmt_nc.c:		Coordinate arrays are now always double precision.

2008-09-05	pwessel
	* mex/imgread.m:	New Matlab/Octave function to read Sandwell/Smith *.img files.

2008-09-01	jluis
	* mapproject.c:		Extended mapproject's -A option by making the fixed point
				optional; if not given we compute azimuths between points.
	* misc/gmtdp.c:		New utility to apply the Douglas-Peucker line-reduction
				algorithm to line data.

2008-08-21	pwessel
	* grdblend.c:		Better treatment of longitude periodicity if -fg is selected.
				E.g., if -Rg is used and a grid is -30/30 in longitude the
				output grid will consider 0-30 and 330-360 correctly.

2008-08-21	remko
	* ps2raster.c:		Needed to backspace a little more to capture BoundingBox at end.

2008-08-14	pwessel
	* grdmath.c:		Some 2nd-order derivatives whose BC yields 0 should yield NaN
				if one or more of the nearby nodes are NaN.  Added NOT operator
	* gmtmath.c:		Same as above for D2DT2.  Added NOT operator.  Also allow data
				columns to contain NaN, and for the time-columns to contain NaN
				if -T is set.

2008-08-14	remko
	* blockmedian.c, psxy.c:	Replaced word "quartile" by the proper "quantile".
				Same in man pages.

2008-08-05	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_get.c:	Now handles -R with longitude periodicity correctly
	* x2sys/x2sys.c:	Swabbing of index files happens automatically

2008-07-23	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77track.c:	Enhanced -A option to place cruise ID equidistantly (dist or time) along the track.

2008-07-16	pwessel
	* grdblend.c:		A side-effect of the 2007-02-01 fix was that when the file
				is re-opened the row range is reset.  Now the possible
				offset is computed during initialization but applied when
				the file is finally opened for reading.
	* ps2raster.c:		Now will scan for the optional comment %%HiResBoundingBox
				which takes precedence over the values in %%BoundingBox.

2008-07-15	pwessel
	* pslib.*:		Now measure paper size in double precision points instead
				of truncating to nearest integer.  To remain backwards
				compatible for pslib users we now initialize all plotting
				in GMT with ps_plotinit_hires.
	* gmt_*.c:		Now use double precision for paper size rather than int.

2008-06-20	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Now applies recalculation of fields requested by E77 flags
				as part of reading netcdf mgd77+ files.  However, if the
				original anomaly was NaN then we leave it as is.

2008-06-13	pwessel
	* grdimage.c:	Failed to determine boundary of projected grid with enough precision.
	* misc/gmtstitch.c:	Check to see if format was set was wrong.
	* mgd77/mgd77track.c:	Missing newline after last source line

2008-06-12	pwessel
	* examples:		Added ex27 for plotting img files and ex28 for plotting UTM
	* psbasemap.c:		The syntax for the -L option had to change since one could
				not easily use the :label: specification if the coordinates
				were given in dd:mm[:ss] format.  A new syntax has been
				implemented where one or more +?[args] strings are appended
				after the required parameters.
	* pscoast.c:		Same.
	* gmt.h, gmt_init.c:	Modified special checks for FreeBSD by also considering _AMD64_

2008-06-11	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77sniffer.c:	Bitwise assignment error was deactivating other fields when
				depth field was missing from a cruise.  Another bitwise error
				was overwriting E77 nav flags when navigation was found on land
				Updated sample grid function to handle longitudes for img files
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Index array error resulting in wrong IGRF start and stop
				years was fixed.
2008-06-09	pwessel
	* xyz2grd.c:		For -E under Windows we used fscanf with a pointer from GMT DLL
				which would fail for mysterious reasons

2008-06-05	pwessel
	grdfilter.c:		Complained if -R was used and xmin was < h.xmin for full
				360-range grid.

2008-06-03	pwessel
	* gmt_init.[ch]:	gmtdefs.encoding.name could be freed even if never allocated.
	* examples/ex27:	New example showing how to plot Mercator *.img grids.

2008-06-02	pwessel
	* pslib.c:		ps_polygon can only split line when rgb[0] == -1 not < 0
				since -3 now means to use a fill pattern.
	* pstext.c:		Enhanced -Z+ option expects z-level values in 3rd column

2008-06-01	pwessel
	* Win installer:	Now installs the GMT include files so users can build their own
				programs that use the GMT libs

2008-05-29	pwessel
	* grdreformat.c:	There is no longer a share/conf/gmt_formats.conf so the
				grdreformat usage message crashes. Introduced new file
				grdreformat.h created by GNUmakefile to include this info.

2008-05-27	pwessel
	* grdfilter.c:		The -D5 did not initialize xscale so filter search box was
				set to region width which typically is much larger.  The bug
				did not affect the results but unnecessarily increased runtime.
2008-05-27	remko
	* pslegend.c:		Let N (number of columns) also affect the printing of labels
	* pslegend.txt:		Made clear that N only affects the printing of symbols and labels

2008-05-22	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c, gmt_init.c:	Added support for enhanced -E option for 3-D perspective
				views which allows the specification of a fixed point (needed for
				creating animations). Updated all programs to use the new option
				and added updated man page and synopsis to all programs.

2008-05-20	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		Did not properly apply PLOT_DEGREE_FORMAT=ddd.x for decimal degrees
	* gmt_map.c:		Determining where parallels and meridians intersected the map
				boundary where susceptible to roundoff for very small regions
	* gmt_plot.c:		Checked for map jumps even for non-periodic map boundaries.

2008-05-19	pwessel
	* pscoast.c:		The -Q option should not require -J
	* pstext.c:		Cannot remove blank lines when in paragraph mode as those
				lines signal the end of each paragraph.
2008-05-18	remko
	* configure.ac:		Version updated to 4.3.2. Added CVS_VERSION switch.
	* src/gmt_version.h.in:	Add date and time to CVS version string.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2008-05-15
	* tar 4.3.1 made and released via email
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2008-05-15	pwessel
	* xyz2grd.c:		The -S option incorrectly insisted that -G needed to be set.

2008-05-12	remko
	* conf/gmtdefaults_{SI,US}.in:	Renamed from .gmtdefaults_* (no longer hidden)
	* configure.ac, gmt_init.c:	Changed accordingly
	* Makefile:		"make install-data" now copies only the appropriate directories
				and file from the share directory, i.e. not CVS directory, and
				.cvsignore and *.in files.
	* src/makefile:		Link libgmtps.$(SL) and libpsl.$(SL) to appropriate libraries.
	* src/x2sys/makefile:	No need for linking libx2sys.$(SL) against netCDF.

2008-05-12	pwessel
	* <suppl>/*.c:		Some supplement programs had a mix of GMT_fopen and fread
				which usually fails under Windows when a dynamic DLL is used.

2008-05-09	remko
	* gmt_support.c:	Allow a little more slop in determining whether primary tick
				is at same location as secondary tick.

2008-05-08	pwessel
	* grd2xyz.c:		For -E: The test for dx == dy was susceptible to round-off

2008-05-07	remko
	* gmt_io.c (GMT_nc_input):	Would not read all columns when no variable names given.

2008-05-06	pwessel
	* gmtselect.c:		Did not like a variable number of columns.  Now OK if ASCII
				i/o and at least 2 (3 with -Z) columns are found.
	* gmt_mgg2_header.c:	Passed 2nd, 3rd arguments to fread in the wrong order, thus
				failed to read GRD98 grids.
	* gmt_init.c:		Now, media size Custom_WxH can use W and H in inch, cm, or m
				by appending i, c, or m to each dimension.

2008-05-05	pwessel
	* psxyz.c:		Memory problem: Since realloc does not initialize we
				must explicitly set the pointer in the PSXYZ_DATA1 structure
				to NULL since we later use the pointer to determine if we
				need to free allocated memory.
	* project.c:		Same for the 2 pointers in the PROJECT_DATA structure.

2008-05-03	pwessel
	* psxy.c:		The -D option erroneously gave error when used properly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2008-05-01
	* tar 4.3.0 made and released via email

2008-05-01	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		GMT_grd_project did not check if x_proj was NaN before trying
				to add/sub 360 degrees, hanging under Windows.

2008-05-01	remko
	* ps2raster.c:		When encountering BoundingBox: (atend), skip to the end.
	* grdsample.c:		Did not allocate enough memory, with crashes resulting.
	* share/conf/*.orig:	Replaced by *.in, and processed by ./configure using AC_SUBST
	* guru/GMT_share_files_ascii.lis:	Removed share/conf files.
	* guru/GMT_src_files_ascii.lis:		Added share/conf/*.in files.
	* configure.ac:		---"---, including setting EPS in BOTH US and SI when --enable-eps
	* guru/gmtguru.macros.orig, GNUmakefile: Added GMT_OTHER to add other flags to configure.

2008-04-29	pwessel
	* grdview.c:		Clarified that -T cannot take -JZ|z, fixed clipping.

2008-04-28	pwessel
	* mgg/mgd77togmt.c:	Did not initialize MGG_SHAREDIR path.

2008-04-28	remko
	* GMT_eckert.sh:	Removed. Was not used by anything.
	* GMT_gall_stereo.sh:	Added example for -JCyl_stere.
	* GMT_Chapter_6*.tex:	Added more information on optional -J parameters. Added some
				historical background.
	* examples, scripts:	Removed options in -J when same as default.

2008-04-26	pwessel
	* README etc:		Updated to reflect recent changes such as only *.bz2 archives
				and references to Windows installers.
	* grdview.c:		The -Qc option failed to set the "build image" flag and produced
				garbage surface tiles.  Also, -T[s] produced polygons that were
				not checked for wrapping at a periodic map boundary.

2008-04-25	pwessel
	* x2sys:		Moved *.def to share/x2sys
	* mgd77/mgd77sniffer.c:	Cumulative fixes & updates since August 2007:
				Added -K option to flip navigation flags (if extreme positions
				cause checking to flag good records rather than bad).
				Added -D[x]r option, where x is any preexisting -D option.
				Appending r tells sniffer to use all records in sniffer output
				rather than omitting records flagged with bad navigation.
				Moved speed checking algorithm to precede any other analysis of
				mgd77 data records, including regression checking. This allows
				extreme nav errors to be flagged and ignored in later analysis.
				Modified speed checking algorithm to compare the current nav fix
				to the previous good nav fix, rather than just the previous nav fix.
				This does a better job of flagging the correct fix when excessive
				speeds are found. Previously the current flag was compared to the
				previous flag and whenever excessive speed was computed the current
				record was flagged. This lead to flagging good records at times when
				it was the previous record that was bad.
				Modified manage to accept flags with NaN time stamps.
				Changed speed check from speed > max_speed to fabs (speed) > max_speed
				Bug in E77 output causing distance to be printed when cruises have time stamps
				Track outliers in decimate function, if more than 5% outliers use the
				maximum possible MGD77 values for the 2D bin table in the decimate function.
				Blocked decimation algorithm when dumping values, gradients, etc., and when
				non-regression related warnings are selected (see -W option). Removed bug
				from excessive offset from grid print command.
				Fixed negative array index bug in precision check code
				Fixed an E77 RLS print bug
				Fixed memory deallocation bug - was GMT_free on out[rec] - now on out[curr]
				Added anomaly recalculation toggle to E77
				Use double instead of float for everything but the GMT grids
				Added anomaly sign tracking also fixed e77 scale and icept for A option
				also cleared up kludgy code in grid and ship regression section

2008-04-24	remko
	* ps2raster:		Use PID to augment the file names of temporary files.
				This is not totally secure, but the alternative, mkstemp, is not
				standard enough (not ISO C90).
				Option -N has become obsolete. Use -S and/or -Te instead.

2008-04-22	pwessel
	* psxy.c:		Now will properly clip polygon outline and not draw it along clipped border.
	* configure.ac:		Added support for --enable-mex-mdir=dir and --enable-mex-xdir=dir
				to override the Matlab/Octave preferred paths for local *.mfiles
				and *.mex functions.
	* install_gmt:		Now uses these new variables when running configure.

2008-04-21	pwessel
	* mapproject.c:		-G+ will compute distance between coordinates in first 4 columns

2008-04-19	pwessel
	* configure.ac, src/makegmt.macros.in, mex/makefile:  Added support for --enable-octave
				as an alternative to --enable-matlab

2008-04-16	remko
	* psxy.c, psxyz.c:	Two bug fixes in both programs.
				- If first symbol in list with size was not circle, it got rejected.
				- When sizes of -Sr or -Sj were read from list, they were always inches.

2008-04-15	remko
	* pslib.c, PSL_*.ps:	Renamed a few PostScript commands; reduced prologues in size.
	* gmt_support.c (GMT_just_decode):	Bug fix: was defaulting to BC, instead of BL.
				Also reduced to two arguments (second being default justification).
	* ps{image,legend}.c:	Reduced arguments in GMT_just_decode.
	* ps{scale,text}.c:	---"---
	* gmt_support.h:	---"---
	* gmt_plot.[ch] (GMT_timestamp):	Added "justify" argument to specify justification of
				the time stamp box. Provided by gmtdefaults or -U option.
	* gmt_init.c:		Added justification to GMT_UNIX_POS. Is now <just>/<dx>/<dy>.
				Also added <just> to -U option parsing.
				Fully backwards compatible with previous versions (default just=BL).
	* gmtdefaults.txt:	---"---
	* explain_-U.txt:	---"---
	* common_options.txt:	---"---
	* gmt{,_globals,_common.h}:	---"---
	* .gmtdefaults_*.orig:	---"---. Set PS_IMAGE_COMPRESS = lzw.

2008-04-14	pwessel
	* psxy[z].c:		Drawing arrows with -SvS and time-coordinates did not work as 2nd time
				coordinate did not get processed properly.

2008-04-13	pwessel
	* grdview.c:		The facade (-N) outline was drawn with contour pen.  Now use -Wf to change
				the facade pen from its default value.
2008-04-11	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_binlist.c:	Could create bad bins because of incorrect reallocation of memory.
	* mex/*.c:		No longer need to include matrix.h separately.  This helps octave compilation.

2008-04-09	remko
	* gmt_init.c (GMT_timestamp):	Added new gmtdefaults value UNIX_TIME_FORMAT, which sets the format for
				the time string in the GMT time stamp (-U option). The default is
				"%Y %b %d %H:%M:%S", which is what was printed up to now, except that
				%e (which is not supported by ISO C90) is replaced by %d.
	* gmtdefaults.txt:	---"---
	* gmt{,_globals.h}:	---"---
	* gmtdefaults_*.orig:	---"---
	* gmt_plot.c:		Use gmtdefs.unix_time_format to format the time stamp. This also requires
				the time stamp box to size with the time string and the additional label
				to move. Tweaked the placement of the strings a bit (better vertical
				placement and relative horizontal placement using spaces).

2008-04-07	remko
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Did not yet properly combine ?varname=suffix on output grid.
	* ps2raster.c:		Security improvements: (1) Replaced tmpnam by mktemp, as tmpnam provides
				a limited number of temp file names. (2) Run commands using system(cmd)
				directly and remove file using remove(file), instead of creating a
				script first.

2008-04-05	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		Fixed final bug in GMT_radial_clip.  Also, GMT_world_map should be
				FALSE for azimuthal projections.  This fixes the -JA -JE pscoast bugs.

2008-04-05	remko
	* gmt_map.c, gmt_proj.c:	Fixed bug in azimuthal equal area projection that had the
				horizon shifted from where it ought to be.
	* *.txt:		Added more short explanations on input and output grid formats.
				In some man pages -F was explained instead of -f.
	* GMT_Chapter_4.tex, GMT_Appendix_B.tex:	Added information on -bic (netCDF tables).

2008-04-04	pwessel
	* gmt_stat.c:		Bug in GMT_median would sometime give subtle mistakes, most noticeable
				when only a few values were passed to the function. Traced to the use
				of size_t variables in expressions that should yield a negative value.

2008-04-04	remko
	* GNUmakefile:		Removed creation of *.tar.gz and GMT_src.zip.
	* configure.ac:		CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS as set by user is ADDED to anything configure
				dreams up. Neither OVERRULES the other.
				NETCDF_LIB and NETCDF_INC can be used to set netCDF locations separately.
				Create versioned shared libraries on Linux.
	* */makefile:		Changes made accordingly.
	* job04c.*:		Renamed from job4c.*
	* run_example_tests.sh:	New test script of example files
	* run_*_tests.sh:	Avoid excessive error messages when compare fails on missing files, etc.
	* ps2raster.c:		Always translate and/or rotate EPS output to origin. Not only when
				in concert with other formats. This makes -P -Te work as -P -Tef.

2008-04-02	remko
	* gmt_grdio.c: 		GMT_is_*_grid now works on header struct. GMT_grd_get_format also strips
				off ?<varname> and stores it in header->varname.
	* gmt_nc.c:		When writing netCDF grid ?<varname> can be used to assign variable name
				and long_name attribute.

2008-04-02	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		The radial clipping would sometimes add arcs using the arc that
				is > 180 degrees.
	* x2sys/x2sys_put.c:	Wrong test when replacing older track info lead to dbase loss.

2008-04-01	pwessel
	* examples/ex19/*:	Next GMT conference is now in 2009.
	* gmt_support.c:	Made GMT_polygon_is_open tolerant of round-off and if
				polygon is not open set last to exactly equal first point.

2008-04-01	remko
	* gmt_proj.c:		Avoid error in GMT_lamb_sph when lat is 90 degrees.

2008-03-29	pwessel
	* pslib.[ch]:		Like in gmt, use PS_exit instead of exit to avoid Matlab shutdown.

2008-03-26	pwessel
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Now the grd i/o support the GMT_[DATA|IMG|GRID]DIR environment settings.
	* grdinfo.c:		Reports actual path to the file (may change if GMT_GRIDDIR is involved).

2008-03-25	pwessel
	* pscontour.c:		Must deallocate *ind memory according to which function was used
	* triangulate.c:	Same.  Only affects Windows's insane memory management.

2008-03-24	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		Added new rectangular clip function using Sutherland/Hodgman algorithm

				examples runs clean in both 32-bit and 64-bit mode as do the entire GMT
				documentation.

2008-03-22	remko
	* gmt_nc.c:		Moved GMT_nc_get_att_text to gmt_io.c so it can be used more generally.
	* gmt_io.c:		Implemented GMT_nc_input to support reading netCDF column data (tables).
				This also required changes to GMT_fopen and making GMT_fclose a real routine
				rather than a macro.
	* gmt_io.h, gmt_globals.h:	Changed accordingly.
	* misc/nc2xy.c:		More space for long_name and units.

2008-03-22	pwessel
	* *.[ch]:		Experimental support for full 64-bit computing with introduction of 8-byte
				integers instead of 4-byte.

2008-03-19	remko
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_map_clip_path):	In polar projection, step size for drawing clip path
				was wrong, resulting in missing wedge in donut shape.

2008-02-27	remko
	* gmt_io.[ch], gmt_calclock.[ch]:	Removed GMT_dt_from_usert, GMT_usert_from_dt, GMT_dtime.
				These were remnants of a time that internal time representation was entirely
				in rata die numbers. Since computations are done extensively with relative
				time (in doubles) keeping the conversion double-to-double became non-sensical.

2008-02-25	pwessel

	* gmt_init.c, gmt_init.h:	GMT_get_time_system and GMT_init_time_system_structure now use
				time_system as argument so that not only the internal time system
				defined in gmtdefs.time_system can be parsed.
				Need to move these functions to gmt_support.c?
				GMT_get_time_system can now also deal with "TIME_UNIT since TIME_EPOCH".
				'T' no longer required in epoch string.
				That means TIME_SYSTEM = "days since 2000-01-01 12:00" works.
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Now reuses GMT_get_time_system and GMT_init_time_system_structure.

2008-02-24	pwessel

				scale, when using rectangles with gradients: Size of rectangles followed
				original order, not inverted. (3) In reverse mode, -Eb was plotting
				foreground triangle, -Ef background triangle.
	* doc/GMT_Appendix_M.tex, doc/scripts/GMT_App_M_2.sh:	Figure added to App M to illustrate uses
				of psscale.

2008-02-20	remko

				TIME_UNIT. When used, set gmtdefs.time_unit and gmtdefs.epoch immediately.
				No longer appears in .gmtdefaults4 file.  No more predefined scale,
				rata_die, etc for time systems. Those are determined from
				gmtdefs.time_{unit,epoch} by GMT_init_time_system_structure instead.

	* doc/html.sty:		Removed: prefer to use official version. GMT_macros.tex changed to accomodate:
				Need to just call \usepackage{html}: it implies \usepackage{hyperref}.

	* doc/GMT_device*.tex:	Removed: no longer needed now that device dependencies are done in GMT_macros.tex.
	* doc/GMT_macros.tex:	Completely revised: now does all common things of GMT_Tutorial and GMT_Docs.
				Added \usepackage{tocbibind} to add toc, bib and ind to Contents.
				Better organised hyperref package. Now implied by \usepackage{html}.

2007-01-14
	* gmt_io.c:		Added GMT_not_numeric(text) function to determine if a text string CANNOT

2006-11-14
	* segyprogs/segy_io.h:	Now includes inttypes.h only when required
	* pscoast.c:		Now requires a map projection (-JX<width> will give error since the
				data is lon,lat.)
	* gmt_mgg2_header2.[ch]:	NGDC has updated the GRD98 format so that the previously unused variable
				unused1 now will hold cell registation (1 = pixel, 0 = gridline), thus
				extending the GRD98 format to pixel grids as well.
				Fixed a bug in which the grid format type (12) got reset to 0, thus
				making grdinfo report the wrong file format.
	* grdfft.c:		-D and -I option could have junk in the parameter arrays if more than

				and -Z in header will decode to corresponding pattern.
				New feature: -W- -W+ will turn off outline or reset to default
				while -G- -G+ will turn off fill or reset to default (in -M).

2006-11-08
	* gmt_init.c:		2006-10-03 fix for Windows was botched; format should have been %c not %s

2006-11-06
	* sample1d.c:		Allow absolute time in -S option (using GMT_scanf_arg).
	* gmtmath.c:		-C now works (used to deselect all columns).

	* make_make.sh:		Now creates grdmath.h and gmtmath.h from grdmath.c and gmtmath.c

2006-11-03
	* gmtmath.c:		Fixed memory allocation bug for files > BUFSIZ records.  Now works correctly
				with multisegment headers.  Multisegment headers now written to the output file
				and not always to stdout.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2006-11-02
	* tar 4.1.4 made and released via email

	* grdcontour.c:		-W[+][c|a] was susceptible to misinterpreting things like -Wcyan as color yan.
	* grdview.c:		-W[c|m] was susceptible to misinterpreting things like -Wcyan as color yan.
	* pstext.c:		-W[<fill>][o|O|c|C][<pen]] is now -W[<fill>,][o|O|c|C][<pen]], i.e., we now use
				a comma to separate the fill and pen (done since fill may be a name containing o|c.
	* psimage.c:		-G<colorname> (e.g., -Gblack) will now be interpreted as foreground color, e.g. -Gfblack

2006-10-29
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Make units check case-insensitive. Check for toggled lat/lon coordinates.
				Fixed time-scaling bug on input (was always seconds).
	* gmt_io.c:		One can now add suffixes 'g' or 'd' to denote geographic coordinates.
	* gmt_init.c:		Made use of geographical and time coordinates more "transparent":
				-R[g|d] forces geographical, so that -JX does not need extra d
				When absolute or relative time is used in -R, -JX does not need extra T or t
				-R[g|d]w/e/s/n[r] also sets geographical.
				Made use of lower and uppercase LlPpDdTtGg consistent.

2006-10-28
	* xyz2grd.c:		Fixed bug in -E header section parsing.

				-F did not use grid registration as default, rather that of input grid
				When using pixel registration, number of cells would be one too large
				-L worked only in very limited case: going from x=[-180;180] to x=[0;360]
				Now supports any periodicity in X and Y (as per manual)

2006-03-07
	* gmt_io.c:		For years, date in format needs %5d, not %4d since we might have
				a negative year (months and days, however, only need %2d).

	* GMT:			Added -Jv (van der Grinten) projection
				Added -Jd (Equidistant conic) projection
				Added -Jkf Eckert IV (f for 4).  Also allow

1999-04-27
	* gmt_defaults.h:	Without .gmtdefaults, paper size was 0x0
	* install_gmt:		Now figures out if binary files written on Suns
				(e.g., data files like world_grav etc) need to be
				swapped on the user's machine.  This is used to
				compile in swapping in some of the supplemental
				programs. Not used by main GMT programs.
	* img2mercgrd.c:	Compiles in swapping if install_gmt says so.

1999-04-12

1999-04-08
	* pslib.c:		Missed final linefeed when -K and absolute
				positioning (-Xa? -Ya?) were used.
	* grdimage.c:		Shit! Somehow, MAPPING was replaced by
				!RECT_GRATICULE on 1998-12-08, i.e. after 3.1.1
				Now fixed (again). All grdimage plots made since
				3.2 came out have problems if they use a map
				projection that had rectangular graticules, like
				Mercator and many cylindrical projections.

1999-04-07
	* pslib.c:		Now knows about DOS drive letters in any
				pattern filenames

	* sample1d.c:		Had memory allocation errors with -M.
				Now also works with -N file that spans the
				range of several -M segments.
	* gmt_plot.c:		GMT_polar_adjust sensitive to round-off which
				could affect orientation of basemap annotations
	* gmt_math_init.csh/bash:	Had wrong #define for the dummy yn(n,x) function

1999-03-26
	* pslib.c:		Added ps_imagemask for transparent bitmaps
	* gmt_support.c:	Understands that fore- or background color in
				-Gp can be - which means transparency

	* grdimage.c:		New -G[f|b]<rgb> option to make transparent
				color masks from otherwise black/white 1-bit
				images

				M (PLM), the fully normalized surface spherical
				harmonic YLM, and POP (delete top stack element).
	* gmtmath.c:		Added PLM and POP, see above.
	* pstext.c:		Now clips same way as psxy.

1999-01-02
	* grdmath.c:		Added j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn, erf, erfc
				which is present in most math libraries,
				and bei, ber, kei, ker from gmt_math.c
				Also log1p which we already use elsewhere.
	* gmtmath.c:		New program with same operators as grdmath
				except it works on tables instead of grids.
	* gmt_math.c:		Contains definitions of bei, ber, kei, ker.
	* gmt_math_init.csh/bash:	Looks for j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn, erf, erfc

				when south was not multiple of y_inc.

1998-12-09
	* *:			All internal calculations in GMT are now done
				using inches.  All input lengths (e.g., map
				scales or widths, distance gaps, symbols sizes,
				etc) that previously were taken as inches or as
				either inch/cm are now scanned to see if they
				have the unit c, i, m, or p appended (c = cm,
				i = inch, m = meter, p = point).  If no unit is
				appended, GMT will default to the unit set by
				MEASURE_UNIT.  Thus, even if MEASURE_UNIT is cm
				one can specify a 6 inch map with -JM6i.
				All the man pages have also been updated.
	* psmegaplot.c:		Updated to deal with GMT 3.0 PS format.  No
				longer need PS files produced with -K at the end.

				of which MEASURE_UNIT is in effect.

1998-12-08
	* grdimage.c:		Had two problems: 1) Clip path did not follow
				the grid but the -R region. 2) images sometimes
				were shifted incorrectly.  Both problems fixed.
	* grdview.c:		Clip path now based on grid, not -R.
				Pixel grids are now processed correctly.

1998-12-02
	* psclip.c:		fclose outside file loop so only ~95 files could
				be opened before we run out of file pointers...
	* gmtselect.c:		Added friendly check to ensure -L and -F gets a
				multisegment file.

1998-12-01
	* gmt_customio.c:	Now reads/writes format # 3 Sun rasterfile header
				correctly on all platforms, like pslib.c
				If you ever used GMT to write Sun rasterfiles
				under Linux, you need to fix the raster headers.

1998-11-30
	* pslib.c:		Added support for Run-Length Encoded rasterfiles.
				PS. this feature has not been extensively tested
				at this point since I haven't gotten many RLE
				files to test on.  Also fixed a bug for 24-bit
				images of odd width.
	* gmthex2ras.c:		Obsolete since Sun rasterfiles are defined at
				the byte level so new read-module in pslib works
				on all platforms.  The GMT patterns will now be
				distributed as binary rasterfiles.

1998-11-29
	* pslib.c:		Read Sun rasters incorrectly on bigendian
				machines.  Now should work ok on all platforms.
	* gmtselect.c:		Now takes -N (and -A, D) to keep/skip points that
				are inside/outside any geographical features
				(coastlines).

1998-11-28

	* pscoast.c:		Now uses GMT_prep_polygons which is defined in
				gmt_shore.c as a new function.
	* grdlandmask.c:	Now uses GMT_prep_polygons instead of duplicate
				code from pscoast.  All progs needing to extract
				and use coastline polygons will use this routine.

1998-11-26
	* grd2xyz.c:		Now gives warning if -bo and -Z are selected.
	* xyz2grd.c:		Now gives warning if -bi and -Z are selected.

1998-11-25
	* project.c:		Got hung if -W or -L was set.  Fixed many typos
				in both man page and usage message.
	* psscale.l:		Had old-style -B example.

				segment headers gives n_fields = 0
	* grdtrack.c:		Failed for -M files; now checks for n_fields >= 0
	* mapproject.c:		Same.
	* pshistogram.c:	Same.
	* psmask.c:		Same.
	* spectrum1d.c:		Same.

				with $USER in shells.  Added gmt_boundcond.h
				to list of include files in makefile.

				and strchr.
	* grdmath_main.c:	passed char rather than int to isdigit
	* pstext.c:		Same.
