  ðŸ’– Thanks for opening this pull request! ðŸ’–

  A few things to keep in mind:

  * If you need help writing tests, take a look at the existing ones for inspiration. If you don't know where to start, let us know and we'll walk you through it.
  * All new features should be documented. It helps to write the comments below for your functions describing the it, **all** arguments, and return types before writing the code. This will help you think about your code design and results in better code.
  * We are grateful that you put in the effort to do this! ðŸŽ‰
