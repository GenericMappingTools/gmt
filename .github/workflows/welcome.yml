            Please make sure you read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

            A few things to keep in mind:

            * If you need help writing tests, take a look at the existing ones for inspiration. If you don't know where to start, let us know and we'll walk you through it.
            * All new features should be documented. It helps to write the comments below for your functions describing the it, **all** arguments, and return types before writing the code. This will help you think about your code design and results in better code.
            * We are grateful that you put in the effort to do this! ðŸŽ‰

            We hope that the contributing process will be a good experience for you. Please let us know if there is any way that it could be improved.
