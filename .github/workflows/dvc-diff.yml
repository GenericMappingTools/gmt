# Report changes in test images
#
# This workflow checks for image diffs in a pull request and adds a GitHub
# comment showing the diff.
#
# It is triggered in a PR when any *.png.dvc files have been added, modified,
# or deleted. A GitHub comment will be published that contains a summary table
# of the images that have changed along with a visual report.
