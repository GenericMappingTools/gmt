            Todo list:

            - [ ] Download latest ScientificColourMapsV.zip file from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1243862
                  to a folder, e.g. ~/Downloads/ScientificColourMapsV, where V is the version number (e.g. 7).
            - [ ] Run `./admin/build-scientific-colors-cpt.sh ~/Downloads/ScientificColourMapsV/` to update CPTs.
            - [ ] Move newly generated CPTs to `share/cpt` using `mv ~/Downloads/ScientificColourMapsV/gmt_cpts/* share/cpt/`
            - [ ] Make sure to update the following files:
              - [ ] Version number in `admin/build-scientific-colors-cpt.sh` and `.github/workflows/scm-check.yml`
              - [ ] List of colour maps in `src/gmt_cpt_masters.h` using lines in `/tmp/cpt_strings.txt` (only if new colour maps were added)
              - [ ] Counts of colour maps in `doc/rst/source/cookbook/cpts.rst` (only if new colour maps were added)
              - [ ] List of colour maps and counts in `doc/scripts/GMT_App_M_1*.sh` (only if new colour maps were added)
            - [ ] Update the associated `doc/scripts/GMT_App_M_1*.ps` file(s)
            - [ ] Commit all changes and open a PR

            **Note**: If new CPTs were added (check using `ls ~/Downloads/ScientificColourMaps`), update the
            `admin/build-scientific-colors-cpt.sh` script first to include the new CPTs, and then rerun it again.
