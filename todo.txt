List of unresolved bugs and desireable enhancements not yet implemented.
If you fix or implement any of these please take them off the list and
remember to add an entry in ChangeLog.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS or "FEATURES":

psbasemap.c	Looks like the magnetic rose needs some alignment work(?)

pshistogram.c:	Bug using -W with time data

psxy[z]:	-Sb -So etc with time data; what is size; how to specify months etc.
		If cpt uses date-clock z-values then automatically set -f2T or -f3T.

GMT_time_array:	Should be able to handle phase shift passed from -B

testing:	Need testing of supplements at some point

gmtselect:	Should -M option cause selection by segment. I.e., if one point
		in segment passes selection, shouldn't the whole segment pass?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENTS:

gmt_init/plot..	Add TICK_LENGTH_SECONDARY (and _PRIMARY)

gmt_*.c:	Separate allocation of memory for plot-related things from the
		core calculation-related things.  E.g., grd2xyz does not need GMT_begin
		to allocated fonts etc.

GIS supplement:	In src/gis, finalize grd2geotiff.c donated from K. Feigl.  Needs work
		on configure and finding libs.  This supplement should also have Lloyd's
		shapefile converter.
		
grd|gmtmath.c	1) Add macro support; macros defined in .gmtmath or passed via -D
		2) Add variable support:  _var will assign stack content to variable
		var which can be used later in the expression.
		
pslegend: 	Add support for typesetting a table?

gmt_plot.c:	Different phase shifts for a, f, g?
		gridlines for x/z, y-z in 3-D (ie. for the vertical walls in the background)
		X_AXIS_TYPE: introduce new parameter to rotate x labels?

grd2cpt.c	Knowledge of some color tables having a "hinge" at 0.  Many cpt files
		are designed with a hinge for z = 0 (e.g. bathy vs topo).  When such
		cpts are used it would be useful if programs like grd2cpt/makecpt
		could know that z = 0 (or any other special z for that matter) is such
		a hinge and that the color change at that z should still map to the
		new z = 0 even if the new zmin/zmax is not symmetric about 0.  This
		would require a flag in the CPT files, e.g. # HINGE = 0.  Several of
		our cpt files would then acquire a HINGE comment.

met:		Supplement with wind barb solution and other symbols.  There are lots
		of meteorology symbols out there - perhaps starting off with a tool
		that can hande the barbs is a good start.

psscale:	Add 3-D view option.  Add 3-D view [Need to reclaim the -E option
		for -Eaz/el but allow backwards comp for current -E option.  Rename
		current -E option as -T.  Also reclaim -Z for setting the z-level
		for 3-D views and move current -Z to -W for bar widths; process
		-Z<file> still for backwardness.

pstext.c	Implement -S option in paragraph mode.

geotiff:	Kurt Feigl has contributed a grd2geotiff.c program but it is mostly
		based on grdimage that I can imagine we could add this extensive
		feature as an option to grdimage.  There is also some shapefile
		support that Lloyd wrote that needs to be finalized; perhaps these
		two things could go into a "gis" supplement.

pslib.c:	Is there a way to make layers partially transparent? I tried "setoverprint"
		in a PostScript test file but it didn't work.
