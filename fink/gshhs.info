Description: Global dataset of shorelines, rivers, borders
DescDetail: <<
 This package provides five different resolution versions of the GSHHS
 (Global Self-consistant Hierarchical High-resolution Shorelines)
 data base: high and full resolution.
 GSHHS combines the World Vector Shoreline and World Data Base II
 products into a single quality-checked hierarchical data base at
 5 resolutions.

 Although these shorelines are distributed as part of the Generic Mapping
 Tools (GMT), they can be used stand-alone or with other applications
 that can read NetCDF files.
